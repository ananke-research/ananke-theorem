# Early universe implications

This page sets out what the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem implies for **early-universe cosmology**, with particular emphasis on singular behaviour, conservation, and the interpretation of cosmic expansion.

The conclusions here are **structural**, not speculative: they follow from closure, conserved quadratic norm, and regime classification.

## 1) The standard singularity problem

In conventional cosmology, backward extrapolation of the Friedmann equations leads to formal singular behaviour:

- scale factor $$a \to 0,$$
- density $$\rho \to \infty,$$
- curvature invariants diverge.

This behaviour is often interpreted as a **Big Bang singularity**, sometimes described as the beginning of spacetime itself.

Even within standard General Relativity, such divergence signals a breakdown of applicability rather than a physically admissible state.

---

## 2) Singularity as an artefact of truncation

Within the Ananke framework, the appearance of a singularity is reinterpreted as a **structural artefact**.

General Relativity corresponds to the **constraint (equilibrium) sector** of gravity. When this sector is treated as universally complete, gravity is effectively **truncated**: the redistributive response required for closure outside vacuum is suppressed by assumption.

When a truncated theory is extrapolated into regimes where closure does not hold, pathological behaviour can appear—not because nature is singular, but because the response structure is incomplete.

---

## 3) Closure forbids divergent behaviour

Closure imposes three non-negotiable requirements:

- a **finite conserved quadratic norm** for the gravitational field,
- orthogonality of constraint and redistributive response modes,
- exhaustion of admissible degrees of freedom under symmetry.

A true singularity would violate all three:

- infinite density or curvature implies divergence of the conserved norm,
- divergence requires uncontrolled creation or destruction of energy,
- such behaviour is incompatible with a closed field.

Within the theorem’s scope, **singular states are therefore not admissible**.

---

## 4) Cosmological regime and the role of the residual degree of freedom

In the homogeneous–isotropic regime, symmetry reduction admits **exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom, the same one appearing in galaxies.

This degree of freedom organises gravity **over volume in time**, yielding the pressureless scaling

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}.
$$

This scaling expresses redistribution of conserved energy. It does not represent energy creation, injection, or divergence.

Any singular origin would require violation of this conservation, which closure forbids.

---

## 5) No singular beginning under closure

A literal singular beginning—understood as a first moment at which energy, curvature, or geometry emerge from nothing—would imply:

- breakdown of conservation across response modes,
- divergence of the quadratic norm,
- failure of closure at the earliest times.

Within the Ananke classification, such behaviour is structurally forbidden.

This does **not** assert a specific alternative history (bounce, cyclicity, steady emergence, etc.). It asserts that **whatever the early-universe behaviour is**, it must respect closure and conserved redistribution.

---

## 6) The expanding-universe interpretation

In standard cosmology, the scaling $$\rho \propto a^{-3}$$ is commonly interpreted within an **expanding-metric ontology**, where space itself grows and matter dilutes accordingly.

Within the closure framework, this mathematical form is retained but its **interpretation is revised**.

The scale factor $$a(t)$$ appears as a **global organising parameter** arising from symmetry reduction and conservation, not necessarily as evidence of physical space being created or stretched.

Closure constrains *how gravitational organisation changes in time*; it does not, by itself, require that space be ontologically expanding.

Thus:

- the equations commonly associated with expansion are recovered,
- but expansion is treated as a **kinematic description**, not a primitive physical process.

The theorem remains neutral on spacetime ontology while forbidding interpretations that require non-conservative creation of energy or geometry.

---

## 7) What replaces the singular picture

The theorem does not provide a detailed early-universe model. Instead, it sharply constrains what is admissible.

Any viable description of the early universe must:

- avoid divergent invariants,
- preserve finite conserved norm,
- maintain continuity of the single redistributive degree of freedom,
- respect symmetry reduction.

This excludes singular creation events while leaving room for multiple non-singular possibilities.

---

## 8) Relation to observations

Observational successes commonly associated with Big Bang cosmology—large-scale homogeneity, early thermal behaviour, cosmic background radiation—are not invalidated by the absence of a singular origin.

What is ruled out is the **interpretation** of these observations as evidence for a literal singular creation of spacetime.

The early universe is reframed as a problem of **field organisation under extreme symmetry**, not of emergence from nothing.

---

## Summary

Within the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) framework:

- singular behaviour is an artefact of treating a truncated gravitational sector as complete,
- closure forbids divergent states and non-conservative beginnings,
- the scaling $$\rho \propto a^{-3}$$ expresses redistribution, not creation,
- expanding-metric descriptions are reinterpreted as kinematic rather than ontological necessities.

The early universe is therefore constrained to be **non-singular in structure**, whatever its detailed history may be.
