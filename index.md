# The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**The Ananke Theorem proves a foundational result in classical gravity.**  
We ask what gravitational structure is admissible *in principle*—specifically, how many degrees of freedom gravity may admit under closure—and what follows deductively from that requirement.

---

## Axioms

- **Classical covariance**  
- **Quadratic closure with finite conserved energy**  
- **Orthogonality of response modes**

---

## Structural result

- **Vacuum rigidity:** In isolated vacuum regimes, closure exhausts all degrees of freedom. Gravity admits **zero residual DOF**, recovering vacuum GR exactly as the closed equilibrium (constraint) sector.  
- **Single non-vacuum residual DOF:** In non-vacuum regimes with sufficient symmetry reduction, closure admits **exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom (no more, no less).

---

## Unique action

The axioms fix a **unique admissible covariant action**, up to boundary terms and invertible local field redefinitions.  
The admissible structure necessarily decomposes into a **constraint (longitudinal)** sector and an orthogonal **redistributive (transverse)** sector, with interaction fixed by closure and conservation.

## Unique action (schematic form)

$$
\begin{aligned}
S \;=\;
\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,
\Big[
&\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}(g)}_{\text{metric / geometric response}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm L}(\phi)}_{\text{longitudinal (constraint)}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm T}(A_\mu)}_{\text{transverse (redistributive)}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm c}(\lambda,\phi,u^\mu)}_{\text{closure / orthogonality}}
\Big] \\
&+\;\underbrace{S_{\rm matter}[g,\psi]}_{\text{external matter coupling}} .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Structural corollaries (under symmetry reduction)

**Galaxies**
- BTFR:
$$
M_b \propto V^4
$$
- RAR (Newtonian + correction):
$$
g_{\rm obs}\ =\ g_{\rm bar}\ +\ C\,g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2}
$$

**Cosmology**
- Pressureless scaling:
ρ ∝ a⁻³

These are ordinarily attributed to **dark matter** and **dark energy** in ΛCDM.  
Where ΛCDM and modified-gravity models typically introduce additional fields, free functions, or tuning, the Ananke Theorem derives the above as consequences of **structural closure**.

   Upstream classification: which classical interaction fields can close under finite conserved energy and covariance.

2. **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem**  
   Core theorem: classification of admissible closed classical gravity and the unique action.

3. **Structural Diagnostics of Gravitational Closure**  
   Bridge layer: necessary and forbidden observational consequences under symmetry reduction; falsification criteria for closure.

4. **Phenomenological Consequences of the Ananke Theorem**  
   Downstream applications: algebraic scaling laws in galaxies and homogeneous cosmology as regime-specific projections.
