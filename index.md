# The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**The Ananke Theorem proves a foundational result in classical gravity.**  
We ask what gravitational structure is admissible *in principle*—specifically, how many degrees of freedom gravity may admit under closure—and what follows deductively from that requirement.

---

## Axioms

- **Classical covariance**  
- **Quadratic closure with finite conserved energy**  
- **Orthogonality of response modes**

---

## Structural result

- **Vacuum rigidity:** In isolated vacuum regimes, closure exhausts all degrees of freedom. Gravity admits **zero residual DOF**, recovering vacuum GR exactly as the closed equilibrium (constraint) sector.  
- **Single non-vacuum residual DOF:** In non-vacuum regimes with sufficient symmetry reduction, closure admits **exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom (no more, no less).

---

## Unique action

The axioms fix a **unique admissible covariant action**, up to boundary terms and invertible local field redefinitions.  
The admissible structure necessarily decomposes into a **constraint (longitudinal)** sector and an orthogonal **redistributive (transverse)** sector, with interaction fixed by closure and conservation.

## Unique action (explicit representative)

$$
\begin{aligned}
S \;=\;& \frac{1}{16\pi G}\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,R
\;+\;\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,\frac{1}{2}\,\nabla_\mu\phi\,\nabla^\mu\phi \\
&+\;\Bigg[
-\;\frac{1}{4}\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
\;+\;\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,\lambda\,\nabla_\mu(\phi\,u^\mu)
\;+\;S_{\mathrm{matter}}[g,\psi]
\Bigg],
\end{aligned}
$$

with
$$
A_\mu := \phi\,u_\mu,
\qquad
F_{\mu\nu} := \nabla_\mu A_\nu-\nabla_\nu A_\mu.
$$

## Structural corollaries (under symmetry reduction)

**Galaxies**
- BTFR:
$$
M_b \propto V^4
$$
- RAR (Newtonian + correction):
$$
g_{\rm obs}\ =\ g_{\rm bar}\ +\ C\,g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2}
$$

**Cosmology**
- Pressureless scaling:
ρ ∝ a⁻³

These are ordinarily attributed to **dark matter** and **dark energy** in ΛCDM.  
Where ΛCDM and modified-gravity models typically introduce additional fields, free functions, or tuning, the Ananke Theorem derives the above as consequences of **structural closure**.

1. **Fundamental Fields Theorem**  
   Upstream classification: which classical interaction fields can close under finite conserved energy and covariance.

2. **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem**  
   Core theorem: classification of admissible closed classical gravity and the unique action.

3. **Structural Diagnostics of Gravitational Closure**  
   Bridge layer: necessary and forbidden observational consequences under symmetry reduction; falsification criteria for closure.

4. **Phenomenological Consequences of the Ananke Theorem**  
   Downstream applications: algebraic scaling laws in galaxies and homogeneous cosmology as regime-specific projections.
