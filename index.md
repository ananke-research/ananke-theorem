# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

This site presents a structural result about classical gravity.

The **Ananke Theorem** asks a single question:  
*What gravitational field structures are admissible in principle if gravity is required to close as a classical field with finite conserved energy?*

The answer is not a new force, substance, or phenomenological modification.  
It is a classification result.

Gravity is shown to be a **polarised classical field** whose admissible response is fixed by closure and symmetry:  
pure constraint geometry in vacuum, and exactly one conserved redistributive degree of freedom beyond vacuum when closure demands it.

## Why this matters

Modern cosmology faces a structural tension:

- General Relativity is exact in isolated vacuum regimes.
- Galaxy dynamics and cosmological scaling laws do not close under GR alone.
- The standard response has been to introduce dark matter, dark energy, or phenomenological modifications.

The Ananke Theorem shows that these phenomena arise instead from an **incomplete accounting of gravitational degrees of freedom**.  
When closure is enforced, no additional substances or free functions are required.

## What is established

From three minimal requirements — classical covariance, quadratic closure with finite conserved norm, and orthogonality of response modes — the theorem derives:

- exact recovery of vacuum General Relativity,
- vacuum rigidity and the absence of extra gravitational charges,
- a unique admissible gravitational action,
- exactly one residual degree of freedom outside vacuum under symmetry,
- galaxy and cosmological scaling laws as structural consequences.

No phenomenological interpolation, tuning, or extra matter sector is introduced.

## Structure of the site

The material is organised deductively:

1. the problem gravity currently faces,
2. the scope and axioms of the analysis,
3. the unique admissible action,
4. the classification of gravitational regimes,
5. consequences for vacuum, galaxies, and cosmology,
6. implications for the early universe and General Relativity,
7. falsification criteria and technical references.

Each page builds on the previous one.

## Status

This is not a speculative proposal or an alternative cosmological model.  
It is a theorem-level classification result with explicit regime-dependent consequences.

The technical papers are archived on Zenodo with permanent DOIs.  
Independent scrutiny, analysis, and critique are explicitly invited.
