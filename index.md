# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem proves a foundational result in classical gravity.**  
We ask what gravitational structure is admissible *in principle*—specifically, how many degrees of freedom gravity may admit under closure—and what follows deductively from that requirement.

\[
M_b \propto V^4
\]

\[
\rho \propto a^{-3}
\]
