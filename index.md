# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**The Ananke Theorem is a structural classification result for classical gravity.**  
It asks what gravitational field structure is admissible *in principle* once gravity is required to close with finite conserved energy.

The result is that gravity is **not constraint geometry alone**, as represented by General Relativity, but a **polarised field** governed by **orthogonal modes of response**:  
a purely geometric constraint mode in vacuum, and **exactly one conserved redistributive mode** beyond vacuum when closure requires it.

## Axioms

- **Classical covariance**  
- **Quadratic closure with finite conserved energy**  
- **Orthogonality of response modes**

These axioms express the minimal structural requirements for gravity to be a closed classical field.  
They eliminate external bookkeeping, phenomenological supplements, and unrestricted degrees of freedom, fixing the admissible response structure uniquely under symmetry reduction.

## Structural result

- **Vacuum rigidity**  
  In isolated vacuum regimes, closure exhausts all degrees of freedom. Gravity admits **zero residual DOF**, recovering vacuum General Relativity exactly as the closed equilibrium (constraint) sector.

- **Single non-vacuum residual DOF**  
  Outside vacuum, under sufficient symmetry, closure admits **exactly one** conserved redistributive degree of freedom. No additional independent degrees of freedom are admissible.

## Unique action (schematic)

$$
\begin{aligned}
S = \int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,
\Big[
&\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}(g)
+\mathcal{L}_{\rm L}(\phi)
+\mathcal{L}_{\rm T}(A_\mu)
+\mathcal{L}_{\rm c}(\lambda,\phi,u^\mu)
\Big]
+ S_{\rm matter}[g,\psi] .
\end{aligned}
$$

In vacuum, symmetry and conservation force the redistributive sector to vanish identically, reducing gravity to pure constraint geometry.  
Beyond vacuum, when the constraint mode alone is insufficient for closure, a single orthogonal redistributive mode is activated, enforcing closure through conserved redistribution rather than additional sources.

## Structural corollaries (under symmetry reduction)

When the unique closed action is reduced under appropriate symmetry classes, the following relations arise as **structural consequences**, not phenomenological assumptions.

### Galaxies

**Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation**
\[
M_b \propto V^4
\]

**Radial Acceleration / Mass–Discrepancy Relation**
\[
g_{\rm obs}-g_{\rm bar} \propto g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2}
\]

### Cosmology

**Pressureless homogeneous scaling**
\[
\rho \propto a^{-3}
\]

These relations are conventionally attributed to dark matter and dark energy.  
In contrast, the Ananke Theorem derives them as **necessary consequences of gravitational closure**, without introducing new substances, free parameters, or interpolation functions.
