# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**The Ananke Theorem establishes a foundational structural result for classical gravity.**  
It asks what gravitational field structure is admissible *in principle* when gravity is required to close with finite conserved energy, and what follows deductively from that requirement.

---

## Axioms

- **Classical covariance**
- **Quadratic closure with finite conserved energy**
- **Orthogonality of response modes**

---

## Structural result

- **Vacuum rigidity:** In isolated vacuum regimes, closure exhausts all degrees of freedom. Gravity admits **zero residual DOF**, recovering vacuum General Relativity exactly as the closed equilibrium (constraint) sector.  
- **Single non-vacuum residual DOF:** Outside vacuum, under sufficient symmetry reduction, closure admits **exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom. No further independent degrees of freedom are admissible.

## Unique action (schematic)

$$
\begin{aligned}
S &= \int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,
\Big[
\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}(g)
+ \mathcal{L}_{\rm L}(\phi) \\
&\qquad+ \mathcal{L}_{\rm T}(A_\mu)
+ \mathcal{L}_{\rm c}(\lambda)
\Big]
+ S_{\rm matter}[g,\psi].
\end{aligned}
$$

## Structural corollaries (under symmetry reduction)

**Galaxies**

$$
M_b \propto V^4
$$

$$
g_{\rm obs}-g_{\rm bar} \propto g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2}
$$

**Cosmology**

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}
$$

These relations are conventionally attributed to dark matter and dark energy in \(\Lambda\)CDM.  
In contrast, the Ananke theorem derives them as consequences of **structural closure**, without additional substances, free functions, or tuning.
