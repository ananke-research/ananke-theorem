# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**The Ananke Theorem establishes a foundational structural result for classical gravity.**  
It asks what gravitational field structure is admissible *in principle* once closure with finite conserved energy is required. 
The result is that gravity is not merely constraint geometry, as posulated in General Relativity, but a polarised field governed by orthogonal modes of response: a purely geometric constraint mode in vacuum, and a single conserved redistributive mode beyond vacuum when closure demands it. 

The result is that gravity is identified ot as constraint geometry alone, as in GR, but as a polarised field, in that it is governed by orthogonal modes of response that ensure redistribution of etc.)

## Axioms

- **Classical covariance**
- **Quadratic closure with finite conserved energy**
- **Orthogonality of response modes**

These axioms express the minimal structural requirements for gravity to close as a classical field. Classical covariance eliminates dependence on external reference structures; quadratic closure with finite conserved energy ensures internal self-regulation without phenomenological bookkeeping; and orthogonality of response modes guarantees that all admissible degrees of freedom are either exhausted or uniquely fixed under symmetry reduction. Together, they define the conditions under which gravity can be complete rather than merely effective.

## Structural result

- **Vacuum rigidity:** In isolated vacuum regimes, closure exhausts all degrees of freedom. Gravity admits **zero residual DOF**, recovering vacuum General Relativity exactly as the closed equilibrium (constraint) sector.  
- **Single non-vacuum residual DOF:** Outside vacuum, under sufficient symmetry reduction, closure admits **exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom. No further independent degrees of freedom are admissible.

## Unique action (schematic form)

$$
\begin{aligned}
S \;=\;
\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,
\Big[
&\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}(g)}_{\text{metric / geometric response}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm L}(\phi)}_{\text{longitudinal (constraint)}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm T}(A_\mu)}_{\text{transverse (redistributive)}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm c}(\lambda,\phi,u^\mu)}_{\text{closure / orthogonality}}
\Big] \\
&+\;\underbrace{S_{\rm matter}[g,\psi]}_{\text{external matter coupling}} .
\end{aligned}
$$

This schematic action makes explicit that General Relativity corresponds to the longitudinal (constraint) mode of the gravitational field in equilibrium, expressed geometrically through the metric sector. In isolated vacuum regimes, symmetry and conservation exhaust all degrees of freedom, forcing the transverse (redistributive) sector to vanish identically. Gravity therefore reduces exactly to constraint geometry alone, and the remaining terms in the action are dormant. Beyond vacuum, however, when matter is present and symmetry is sufficient but the constraint mode alone is no longer adequate to achieve closure, the gravitational field must organise across space and time. In these regimes, a single orthogonal redistributive mode is activated, enforcing closure through conserved redistribution rather than additional sources. Gravity is thus structurally polarised: mass–energy sources inertia through the longitudinal mode, while acceleration, large-scale organisation, and non-vacuum departures arise from an orthogonal mode of response required by closure.

## Structural corollaries (under symmetry reduction)

When the unique closed gravitational action is reduced under the appropriate symmetry classes, the following relations arise as **structural consequences**, not phenomenological assumptions.

### Galaxies

**Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation (BTFR):**

$$
M_b \propto V^4
$$

**Radial Acceleration Relation / Mass–Discrepancy–Acceleration Relation (RAR / MDA):**

$$
g_{\rm obs}-g_{\rm bar} \propto g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2}
$$

### Cosmology

**Pressureless homogeneous scaling:**

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}
$$

These relations are conventionally attributed to **dark matter** and **dark energy** within the standard cosmological model **ΛCDM**.

In contrast, the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem derives all of the above as **algebraic consequences of structural closure**, without introducing additional substances, free parameters, interpolation functions, or unrestricted degrees of freedom.
