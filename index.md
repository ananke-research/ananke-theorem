# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**The Ananke Theorem establishes a foundational structural result for classical gravity.**  
It asks what gravitational field structure is admissible *in principle* when gravity is required to close with finite conserved energy, and what follows deductively from that requirement.

---

## Axioms

- **Classical covariance**
- **Quadratic closure with finite conserved energy**
- **Orthogonality of response modes**

---

## Structural result

- **Vacuum rigidity:** In isolated vacuum regimes, closure exhausts all degrees of freedom. Gravity admits **zero residual DOF**, recovering vacuum General Relativity exactly as the closed equilibrium (constraint) sector.  
- **Single non-vacuum residual DOF:** Outside vacuum, under sufficient symmetry reduction, closure admits **exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom (redistribution). No further independent degrees of freedom are admissible.

## Unique action (schematic form)

$$
\begin{aligned}
S \;=\;
\int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,
\Big[
&\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}(g)}_{\text{metric / geometric response}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm L}(\phi)}_{\text{longitudinal (constraint)}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm T}(A_\mu)}_{\text{transverse (redistributive)}} \\
&+\;\underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\rm c}(\lambda,\phi,u^\mu)}_{\text{closure / orthogonality}}
\Big] \\
&+\;\underbrace{S_{\rm matter}[g,\psi]}_{\text{external matter coupling}} .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Structural corollaries (under symmetry reduction)

When the unique closed action is reduced under the appropriate symmetry classes, the following relations arise as **structural consequences**, not phenomenological assumptions.

### Vacuum (isolated systems)

**Inverse-square law (GR vacuum rigidity):**

$$
g(r)\propto \frac{1}{r^2}
$$

In isolated vacuum, closure exhausts all degrees of freedom, so gravity reduces to pure **surface-area geometry** and inverse-square scaling is fixed uniquely.

---

### Galaxies (stationary extended systems)

**Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation (BTFR):**

$$
M_b \propto V^4
$$

In stationary extended systems, closure admits exactly one redistributive degree of freedom that organises gravity over **radius**, fixing a global acceleration scale and yielding the $V^4$ law.

**Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR):**

$$
g_{\rm obs}-g_{\rm bar} \propto g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2}
$$

The same redistributive degree of freedom produces a universal **radial** acceleration relation linking local deviation to the baryonic field.

**Mass–Discrepancy–Acceleration Relation (MDA), equivalent form:**

$$
\left(\frac{g_{\rm obs}}{g_{\rm bar}}-1\right)\propto g_{\rm bar}^{-3/2}
$$

Equivalently, the apparent mass discrepancy follows a fixed power law in **radius**, determined by closure rather than additional matter.

---

### Cosmology (homogeneous–isotropic)

**Pressureless homogeneous scaling:**

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}
$$

Under homogeneous cosmological symmetry, spatial structure is removed and the same residual degree of freedom governs **volume** through time, yielding pressureless scaling.

**Unification statement:** The galaxy and cosmological scaling laws are different symmetry-projections of the **same single redistributive degree of freedom**: in galaxies it organises the field over **radius** (BTFR, RAR/MDA), while in cosmology it organises the field over **volume** (homogeneous scaling).

These relations are conventionally attributed to **dark matter** and **dark energy** within the standard cosmological model **ΛCDM**.  
In contrast, the Ananke theorem derives them as consequences of **structural closure**, without additional substances, free parameters, interpolation functions, or unrestricted degrees of freedom.
