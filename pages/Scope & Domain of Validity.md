title: Scope and Domain of Validity

# Scope and domain of validity

This page states, in operational terms, where the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem applies, what it classifies, and what it does not address.

The theorem is a structural classification result. It constrains admissible gravitational response structures under a specific set of requirements (classical covariance, quadratic closure with finite conserved norm, and orthogonal response modes). Its conclusions are therefore conditional: they hold whenever the regime assumptions of closure and symmetry reduction apply.

---

## 1) What the theorem applies to

The theorem applies to classical gravity treated as a closed field: a covariant response structure admitting a finite conserved quadratic norm, whose functional freedom is exhausted under symmetry reduction.

Within that scope, it classifies:

- admissible response modes under closure,  
- how degrees of freedom are exhausted in isolated vacuum regimes,  
- what residual (non-vacuum) freedom is permitted under symmetry-reduced extended systems,  
- and what structural additions are forbidden.

---

## 2) Regime conditions used by the classification

The classification statements are regime-dependent. The relevant regime conditions are:

- classical (non-quantum) field description;  
- covariance (no preferred background structure);  
- closure (finite conserved quadratic norm; no external bookkeeping);  
- sufficient symmetry reduction (functional freedom is exhausted by the symmetry class);  
- isolation for vacuum statements (no external sources in the exterior region);  
- stationarity for galaxy-type statements (time-independent, symmetry-reduced extended systems);  
- homogeneity (and optionally isotropy) for cosmological symmetry reduction.

Where these regime conditions fail, the theorem does not automatically apply.

## 3) Vacuum domain (isolated exteriors)

In isolated, symmetry-reduced vacuum regimes, closure exhausts all residual degrees of freedom. The theorem therefore enforces vacuum rigidity: the admissible exterior response reduces to the closed equilibrium (constraint) sector, recovering vacuum General Relativity exactly.

This is a statement about the isolated vacuum exterior regime. It is not a claim that all gravitational phenomena everywhere are “vacuum-like”.

---

## 4) Non-vacuum domain (symmetry-reduced extended systems)

In non-vacuum regimes with sufficient symmetry reduction, closure admits exactly one conserved residual degree of freedom and no more. This residual freedom appears as a conserved redistributive contribution required for closure once the constraint sector alone is insufficient to organise the field over the relevant domain.

The theorem does not require phenomenological interpolation functions, free functional freedoms, or additional gravitational charges. If more than one independent residual degree of freedom is required in a purported closure regime, closure is falsified as defined.

---

## 5) Cosmological symmetry domain (homogeneous reduction)

Under homogeneous (and homogeneous–isotropic) symmetry reduction, the classification constrains which conserved structures can appear in the reduced dynamics. In particular, conservation over comoving three-volume enforces pressureless scaling:

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}.
$$

The theorem is agnostic about interpretive language (e.g. “expansion”) beyond the symmetry-reduced equations. It classifies admissible reduced structure, not metaphysical interpretation.

---

## 6) What the theorem does not address

The theorem does not, by itself:

- provide a quantum theory of gravity or quantise the admissible modes;  
- unify gravity with other interactions;  
- derive the Standard Model or particle content;  
- determine detailed astrophysical initial conditions or baryonic microphysics;  
- guarantee that every real system satisfies the symmetry assumptions used for a given reduction;  
- replace empirical model checking (it constrains what is admissible; observations decide whether closure holds in nature).

---

## 7) How to use this page

Use the theorem’s conclusions only after matching the system of interest to the relevant regime conditions:

- for vacuum rigidity claims: isolated vacuum exterior + symmetry reduction;  
- for galaxy-scale structural corollaries: stationary, symmetry-reduced extended systems;  
- for cosmological corollaries: homogeneous (optionally isotropic) reduction.

If the symmetry assumptions are materially broken, apparent violations can arise from symmetry breaking rather than failure of closure.
