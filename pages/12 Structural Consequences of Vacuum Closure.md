## 12 — Structural consequences of vacuum closure

> **PDF correspondence:** Sections 16–17 of the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem (Zenodo v1.0)

Vacuum zero-degree-of-freedom closure has immediate and far-reaching structural consequences. These results do not depend on the detailed form of field equations or on phenomenological input. They follow directly from rigidity, covariance, and exhaustion of functional freedom.

### Uniqueness of exterior solutions

In isolated vacuum regimes, no residual degrees of freedom remain. The gravitational field configuration is therefore uniquely fixed by boundary conditions.

No additional parameters, profiles, screening mechanisms, or environment-dependent modifications are admissible. Any such freedom would constitute a residual degree of freedom and is excluded by closure.

Exterior uniqueness is thus a structural consequence rather than a special property of particular gravitational equations.

### Inverse-square scaling as structural necessity

In three spatial dimensions, uniqueness, isotropy, and scale freedom together admit only a single admissible radial dependence for a vacuum gravitational field.

Under zero-degree-of-freedom closure, the exterior field must be:

- source-determined,
- isotropic,
- free of intrinsic length scales,
- and free of adjustable parameters.

These requirements uniquely fix inverse-square radial scaling as the only admissible behaviour compatible with closure in three dimensions.

Inverse-square scaling therefore follows as a **classification result**, not as a dynamical coincidence or empirical fit. Any alternative radial dependence would introduce an intrinsic scale, violate isotropy, or reintroduce residual degrees of freedom, all of which are excluded.

### Birkhoff-type rigidity

Time-independence of spherically symmetric vacuum configurations follows immediately from vacuum rigidity.

With no redistributive mode and no residual degrees of freedom, spherically symmetric vacuum fields cannot evolve dynamically. Any time dependence would require an admissible degree of freedom, which closure forbids.

Birkhoff-type rigidity is therefore a structural consequence of closure rather than a special feature of particular gravitational field equations.

### Structural recovery of Newtonian gravity and vacuum General Relativity

At no stage have Newtonian gravity or General Relativity been assumed. Nevertheless, the preceding results enforce:

- unique exterior behaviour,
- inverse-square scaling,
- absence of propagating vacuum degrees of freedom,
- universal coupling to sources.

Any admissible gravitational theory satisfying Axioms I–III must therefore recover Newtonian gravity and vacuum General Relativity exactly in isolated regimes.

Their empirical success reflects the fact that they describe the **maximally constrained regime** of the gravitational field. Apparent limitations outside vacuum arise only when a purely constraint-dominated description is extended beyond the domain in which full closure holds.

### Significance

Vacuum gravity is not merely simple; it is **structurally complete**. Its rigidity, universality, and exactness follow from closure rather than from privileged assumptions or fine-tuned dynamics.

With the consequences of vacuum closure established, the analysis now turns to how non-vacuum regimes may arise as controlled departures from this fully constrained limit.
