# Physics FAQ

This page addresses common **physics and mathematical** questions about the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem.  
It focuses on structure, degrees of freedom, and regime-dependent consequences, not interpretation or philosophy.

---

## 1) What is the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem?

The Ananke Theorem is a structural classification result for classical gravity. It asks what gravitational field structures are admissible in principle once gravity is required to close with finite conserved energy under classical covariance. It is not constructed by fitting data or modifying General Relativity phenomenologically.

---

## 2) What does “closure” mean here?

Closure means that the gravitational field is self-regulating: it admits a finite conserved quadratic norm and, under sufficient symmetry reduction, exhausts its functional freedom. No external bookkeeping, hidden components, or regime-dependent prescriptions are permitted.

---

## 3) Is this a modified-gravity theory?

No. The theorem does not add terms to General Relativity to explain anomalies. Instead, it classifies which response structures are admissible if gravity is required to close. Phenomenology appears only downstream, after symmetry reduction of the uniquely admissible closed structure.

---

## 4) Does the theorem modify General Relativity?

In isolated vacuum regimes, no. Closure implies vacuum rigidity: all residual degrees of freedom are exhausted, and gravity reduces exactly to vacuum General Relativity (and to Newtonian gravity in the weak-field limit). No screening mechanisms or tuning are required.

---

## 5) What axioms are assumed?

The classification proceeds from three minimal structural requirements:

- classical covariance  
- quadratic closure with finite conserved norm  
- orthogonality of response modes  

These are not phenomenological assumptions but conditions used to determine admissible classical gravitational structure.

---

## 6) What are “orthogonal modes of response”?

The gravitational response decomposes into two orthogonal components:

- a constraint (longitudinal) response sourced by matter and exhausted in vacuum  
- a redistributive (transverse) response that may carry exactly one conserved residual degree of freedom in non-vacuum symmetry-reduced regimes  

Orthogonality prevents uncontrolled mixing between these responses, enabling rigidity in vacuum and controlled behaviour beyond vacuum.

---

## 7) What is the central degrees-of-freedom result?

In isolated vacuum regimes, closure and symmetry exhaust all freedom, leaving zero residual degrees of freedom.  
In non-vacuum regimes with sufficient symmetry reduction, closure admits exactly one conserved residual degree of freedom and no more.

There is no intermediate case under the stated regime assumptions.

---

## 8) What is meant by “vacuum rigidity”?

Vacuum rigidity means that, in isolated vacuum exteriors, the redistributive response vanishes identically and no residual integration constants survive. Exterior behaviour is therefore unique, enforcing inverse-square scaling in the weak field and recovering vacuum General Relativity exactly.

---

## 9) If vacuum has zero residual degrees of freedom, how do gravitational waves exist?

“Zero residual degrees of freedom” refers to residual structural freedom in the isolated, symmetry-reduced vacuum exterior regime. It does not deny the existence of propagating tensor modes in dynamical, non-stationary settings described by General Relativity. The rigidity statement applies only within the specified regime conditions.

---

## 10) Does the theorem require a specific action?

Yes. Under the closure and orthogonality requirements, the admissible covariant gravitational action is fixed uniquely up to equivalence. Adding or removing terms introduces forbidden degrees of freedom or violates closure.

---

## 11) What does “unique up to equivalence” mean?

Two actions are equivalent if they differ only by boundary terms, invertible local field redefinitions, or normalisation conventions. Such differences do not change the physical content or degree-of-freedom structure relevant to the theorem.

---

## 12) Does the theorem introduce new matter fields?

No. Matter couples minimally to the metric. The residual non-vacuum structure appears as a conserved redistributive contribution required by closure, not as an additional matter species or charge.

---

## 13) Is this MOND or related to MOND-like theories?

No. MOND-like frameworks introduce phenomenological acceleration scales and interpolation functions. The Ananke Theorem introduces neither.

However, the framework does explain why MOND-like scaling relations can appear in galaxy dynamics under appropriate symmetry and stationarity conditions. In the Ananke framework, these scalings arise as structural consequences of gravitational closure in non-vacuum symmetry-reduced regimes, not as phenomenological modifications of the gravitational law.

MOND therefore appears as an effective description of a specific regime, rather than as a fundamental theory.

---

## 14) Where does the single extra constant come from?

It arises as a conserved integration constant of the symmetry-reduced field equations in admissible non-vacuum regimes. It is not inserted by hand at the action level and disappears continuously in the vacuum limit.

---

## 15) What does the theorem imply for galaxies?

In stationary, symmetry-reduced extended systems, the residual redistributive contribution yields a single algebraic relation governing circular motion. Standard galaxy regularities then appear as consequences of this structure, including:

Baryonic Tully–Fisher scaling:

$$
M_b \propto V^4
$$

Radial-acceleration / mass-discrepancy scaling:

$$
g_{\rm obs} - g_{\rm bar} \propto g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2}
$$

These relations arise structurally within the stated regime assumptions.

---

## 16) Is this fitting galaxy data?

No. The theorem does not fit data. It states which scaling structures are admissible if closure holds in the relevant regime. Empirical comparison is separate and downstream.

---

## 17) What does the theorem imply for cosmology?

Under homogeneous (and homogeneous–isotropic) symmetry reduction, conservation over comoving three-volume enforces pressureless scaling:

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}
$$

Any additional homogeneous contribution must arise as the single admissible conserved structure in that regime. Independent vacuum-surviving cosmological terms are not permitted under closure within the theorem’s scope.

---

## 18) Does this require an expanding metric?

The theorem itself is agnostic. It classifies admissible reduced dynamics and conserved structures. Interpretations in terms of expansion or alternative parameterisations lie downstream and are not required by the classification.

---

## 19) How does this relate to the equivalence principle?

Within the closure framework, universal coupling follows structurally: once residual degrees of freedom are eliminated in vacuum, mass–energy is the only conserved extensive quantity available to source the constraint response. Equivalence appears as a structural consequence rather than an independent postulate.

---

## 20) Is this a unified field theory?

It is a unification of classical gravity, not a unification of all interactions.

Newtonian gravity, vacuum General Relativity, galaxy-scale dynamics, and homogeneous cosmology appear as regime-dependent expressions of a single closed classical gravitational field. The identification of a genuine transverse degree of freedom beyond vacuum also removes a key structural obstruction to quantisation, opening gravity to quantisation in principle, though any quantum theory lies beyond the scope of the present work.

---

## 21) What would falsify gravitational closure?

Any confirmed observation within an admissible regime that requires more than one residual non-vacuum degree of freedom, additional independent long-range gravitational charges in vacuum, or violation of a structural necessity implied by closure under the regime’s symmetry assumptions would falsify closure as defined.
