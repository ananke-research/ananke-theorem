# Physics FAQ

This FAQ covers the **physical and mathematical** content of the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem and its downstream results.  
It does **not** address ontology, interpretation, or philosophy (see the Ontology FAQ).

---

## 1) What is the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem?

A **structural classification theorem** for classical gravity. It asks what gravitational field structures are admissible *in principle* once gravity is required to **close** with **finite conserved energy** under **classical covariance**. It is not a phenomenological modification and does not begin from data-fitting.

---

## 2) What does “closure” mean in this context?

Closure means the gravitational field is **self-regulating** in regimes where conserved quantities are well-defined: it admits a **finite conserved norm/energy**, and under sufficient symmetry reduction it **exhausts** all functional freedom, leaving at most discrete conserved integration constants. Closure excludes regime-dependent prescriptions, hidden bookkeeping, and unrestricted functional freedom.

---

## 3) Is this a “modified gravity” theory?

No. The theorem is **not** constructed by adding terms to GR to fit anomalies. It classifies admissible structure given closure. Any phenomenology appears only *downstream* as a consequence of symmetry reduction of the uniquely admissible closed structure.

---

## 4) Does the theorem change General Relativity?

No in vacuum. In **isolated vacuum regimes**, closure implies **vacuum rigidity**: there are **zero residual degrees of freedom** and the theory reduces **exactly** to vacuum GR (and to Newtonian gravity in the weak-field limit). No screening mechanisms or parameter tuning are required.

---

## 5) What are the axioms of the theorem?

The minimal axioms are:

- **Classical covariance**
- **Quadratic closure with finite conserved norm**
- **Orthogonality of response modes** (constraint vs redistributive)

These are structural requirements used to classify admissible classical gravitational response structures.

---

## 6) What does “orthogonal modes of response” mean physically?

The gravitational response decomposes into two **orthogonal** components:

- a **constraint (longitudinal)** response sourced by matter and exhausted in vacuum,
- a **redistributive (transverse)** response that can carry exactly one conserved residual degree of freedom in non-vacuum symmetry-reduced regimes.

Orthogonality means no algebraic mode-mixing: the sectors do not arbitrarily exchange freedom, enabling rigidity in vacuum and controlled activation beyond vacuum.

---

## 7) What is the central degrees-of-freedom (DOF) result?

- **Vacuum (isolated)**: closure + symmetry exhaust all freedom ⇒ **0 residual DOF**.
- **Non-vacuum, symmetry-reduced**: closure admits **exactly 1** conserved residual DOF (redistributive), and **no more**.

There is no intermediate case and no allowance for additional universal gravitational charges or free functions under the stated regime assumptions.

---

## 8) What is meant by “vacuum rigidity”?

In isolated vacuum regimes, the redistributive mode vanishes identically and no residual integration constants survive. Exterior behaviour is unique under the admissibility conditions of the vacuum regime, enforcing inverse-square scaling in the weak field and recovering vacuum GR exactly.

---

## 9) If vacuum has “zero residual DOF,” how can there be gravitational waves?

“Zero residual DOF” here refers to **residual structural freedom under symmetry-reduced vacuum closure** (i.e. no additional integration-constant freedom beyond the constraint sector in the isolated vacuum regime). It does not deny GR’s propagating tensor modes in dynamical, non-stationary settings. The theorem’s rigidity statement applies to the **isolated vacuum exterior regime** under the stated conditions.

---

## 10) Does the theorem require a specific action?

Yes. Under the axioms, the admissible covariant gravitational action is fixed **uniquely up to equivalence** (boundary terms, invertible local field redefinitions, and normalisation conventions). Any additional terms introduce forbidden degrees of freedom or violate closure.

---

## 11) What does “unique up to equivalence” mean?

Two actions are considered equivalent if they differ only by:

- boundary terms,
- invertible local field redefinitions,
- overall normalisation conventions.

Such changes do not alter the physical content or degree-of-freedom structure within the theorem’s scope.

---

## 12) Does the theorem introduce new matter fields?

No. Matter couples minimally to the metric in the admissible closed action. The residual non-vacuum structure arises as a conserved redistributive contribution required by closure under symmetry, not as an additional matter species.

---

## 13) Is this MOND, TeVeS, Einstein–Æther, or a cousin?

No. Those frameworks are typically model classes with tunable couplings, extra charges, or phenomenological elements. The Ananke Theorem is a **closure classification** with:

- exact GR recovery in vacuum (structural),
- no interpolation functions,
- no per-system tuning parameters,
- a single admissible residual DOF in symmetry-reduced non-vacuum regimes.

---

## 14) Where does the “single extra constant” come from?

It arises as a **conserved integration constant** of the symmetry-reduced field equations in the non-vacuum regime admitted by closure. It is not inserted at the action level as a new universal coupling; it appears only once symmetry reduction exhausts functional freedom and a residual redistributive mode is admissible.

---

## 15) What does the theorem imply for galaxies?

In stationary, symmetry-reduced extended systems, the residual redistributive contribution yields a single algebraic relation governing circular motion. Standard galaxy regularities then appear as different observational projections of this relation, including:

**Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation**

$$
M_b \propto V^4
$$

**Radial Acceleration / Mass–Discrepancy Relation**

$$
g_{\rm obs}-g_{\rm bar} \propto g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2}
$$

These are structural corollaries within the stated regime conditions.

---

## 16) Is this “fitting” galaxy data?

No. The theorem and the symmetry-reduced classifications do not fit data. They state which scaling structures are admissible once closure holds in the relevant regime. Empirical comparison is separate and occurs downstream.

---

## 17) What does the theorem imply for cosmology?

Under homogeneous (and homogeneous–isotropic) symmetry reduction, conservation over comoving three-volume enforces pressureless scaling:

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}
$$

Any additional homogeneous contribution must arise as the single admissible residual conserved structure in that regime; no independent vacuum-surviving cosmological term is permitted under closure within the theorem’s scope.

---

## 18) Does this require an expanding metric?

The theorem itself is agnostic about interpretation. It classifies admissible symmetry-reduced dynamics and conserved structures under closure. Whether one interprets the reduced equations as “expansion” or as an effective parameterisation of homogeneous evolution is downstream and not required for the theorem’s validity.

---

## 19) How does this relate to the equivalence principle?

Within the closure framework, universal coupling follows structurally: once closure eliminates residual degrees of freedom in vacuum, the only conserved extensive quantity available to source the constraint response is mass–energy. This provides a structural route to equivalence rather than treating it as an independent postulate.

---

## 20) What observational domains does the theorem claim?

The theorem makes **regime-conditional** claims:

- **Vacuum isolated exteriors**: exact GR / Newtonian recovery; no additional structure.
- **Non-vacuum symmetry-reduced**: exactly one residual redistributive DOF; fixed-form scaling corollaries.

Outside these regimes (strong symmetry breaking, time-dependence beyond the regime assumptions, complex environments), the theorem does not claim universal algebraic laws.

---

## 21) What would falsify gravitational closure?

Any confirmed observation within an admissible regime that requires:

- more than one residual non-vacuum degree of freedom,
- additional independent long-range gravitational charges in vacuum,
- or violation of a structural necessity implied by closure under the regime’s symmetry assumptions,

would falsify closure as defined.

---

## 22) What are common misreadings to avoid?

- “It modifies GR everywhere.”  
  **False** — GR is recovered exactly in isolated vacuum regimes.

- “It is MOND with different language.”  
  **False** — no interpolation functions or phenomenological acceleration scales are postulated.

- “It denies gravitational waves.”  
  **False** — vacuum rigidity refers to residual structural freedom in isolated vacuum exteriors, not to GR’s radiative tensor modes in dynamical settings.

- “It proves dark matter or dark energy do not exist.”  
  **False** — it shows certain phenomena do not *require* new substances if closure holds.
