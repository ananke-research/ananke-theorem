## 05 — Immediate structural consequences

Although Axioms I–III are logically independent, their joint imposition places strong and immediate restrictions on admissible gravitational field structures. The results stated here follow necessarily from the axioms alone and require no additional assumptions, dynamical input, or phenomenological interpretation.

### Elimination of functional freedom under symmetry

Quadratic closure and covariance together imply that, once sufficient spacetime symmetry is imposed, admissible field equations reduce to operators of fixed functional form. Orthogonality prevents deficiencies in one response mode from being absorbed by another, while covariance ensures that these restrictions are independent of coordinate choice.

Accordingly, in any sufficiently symmetric regime, admissible solutions cannot retain arbitrary functions of space or time. Any residual freedom must appear exclusively as discrete integration constants fixed by conservation laws.

This restriction is structural. It does not depend on a particular representation of the gravitational field or on the form of its equations of motion.

### Proposition — Exhaustion of residual freedom by symmetry

**Proposition.**  
Under sufficient spacetime symmetry, the gravitational field equations admit no functional degrees of freedom. Only integration constants fixed by conservation may remain.

This result follows directly from Axioms I–III once finite-energy admissibility and symmetry reduction are imposed. Any surviving functional freedom would require supplementary regulating structure, thereby violating internal closure.

### Clarification on degrees of freedom

Throughout this work, a *degree of freedom* refers exclusively to unfixed functional or parametric freedom that survives symmetry reduction and conservation, including residual integration constants. It does not refer to kinematical field components prior to the imposition of closure and admissibility.

With this convention, statements concerning zero, one, or multiple degrees of freedom are statements about what remains structurally admissible after all closure requirements are enforced.

### Consequence for gravitational rigidity

The exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry is a foundational consequence of closure. It underlies:

- rigidity and uniqueness of vacuum solutions,
- the absence of adjustable parameters in isolated exterior fields,
- and the restriction of non-vacuum structure to controlled departures from the vacuum-closed limit.

No specific field decomposition, equation of motion, or geometric interpretation has been assumed. The result applies to any classical gravitational field satisfying Axioms I–III.

With functional freedom eliminated, the remaining task is to determine how many independent response modes are compatible with closure. This question is addressed next.
