## 14 — Residual degree of freedom: existence, uniqueness, and character

> **PDF correspondence:** Sections 20–21 of the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem (Zenodo v1.0)

With the admissibility of controlled departures from vacuum closure established, we now determine the **existence, number, and character** of any residual degrees of freedom permitted in non-vacuum but symmetry-reduced regimes.

The analysis proceeds by elimination under closure, quadratic energy conservation, and orthogonality.

### Counting residual degrees of freedom

Quadratic closure and orthogonality restrict admissible gravitational response to two sectors: a constraint sector and a redistributive sector. In non-vacuum regimes, the redistributive sector need not vanish identically. However, exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry continues to apply.

Any residual freedom must therefore:

- reside entirely within the redistributive sector,
- be fixed by conservation and symmetry,
- and introduce no independent vacuum structure.

### Lemma — At most one residual degree of freedom

**Lemma.**  
In any symmetry-reduced non-vacuum regime, a closed classical gravitational field admits **at most one** residual degree of freedom.

**Structural justification.**  
If more than one independent residual degree of freedom remained, their relative amplitudes would require additional regulating constants or functions. Such freedom is not fixed by conservation laws and would violate quadratic closure with finite conserved energy. Accordingly, more than one residual degree of freedom is inadmissible.

### Lemma — At least one residual degree of freedom

**Lemma.**  
In extended non-vacuum regimes, closure requires **at least one** residual degree of freedom.

**Structural justification.**  
A purely constraint-dominated field enforces local balance but provides no mechanism for organising gravitational influence across extended spatial or temporal domains. In such regimes, absence of any residual redistributive structure prevents closure. At least one residual degree of freedom is therefore required.

### Theorem — Existence and uniqueness of the residual degree of freedom

**Theorem.**  
In any admissible non-vacuum but symmetry-reduced regime, a closed classical gravitational field possesses **exactly one** residual degree of freedom.

**Structural justification.**  
The preceding lemmas exclude both zero and more than one residual degree of freedom. Exactly one remains admissible.

This result is purely structural. It establishes existence and uniqueness without specifying the detailed form of the residual structure.

### Character of the residual degree of freedom

The admissible residual degree of freedom is subject to strict constraints. It:

- cannot appear as an independent scalar field, as this would modify the constraint sector and persist in vacuum;
- cannot appear as a free vector field with an independent kinetic term, as this would admit propagating vacuum modes;
- must vanish identically, or reduce to pure gauge, in the vacuum limit;
- introduces no additional universal constants;
- derives its magnitude and behaviour entirely from conservation and coupling to the constraint sector.

Accordingly, the residual degree of freedom cannot exist as an independent fundamental field. Its admissible realisation must be subordinate to the constraint sector and consistent with closure.

---

### Significance

Exactly one residual degree of freedom is permitted outside vacuum, and its character is tightly constrained. This result fixes the allowable form of non-vacuum gravitational structure prior to any action-level construction.

The remaining task is to determine how this residual structure may be realised without violating closure, conservation, or orthogonality. This is addressed next.
