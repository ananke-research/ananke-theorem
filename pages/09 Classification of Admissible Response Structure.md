## 09 — Classification of admissible response structure

With closure, covariance, exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry, and forced orthogonality established, the admissible internal response structure of a closed classical gravitational field can now be classified exhaustively.

The classification proceeds by elimination. Possible numbers and types of response sectors are ruled out where they violate closure, conservation, or energetic admissibility.

### Exclusion of a single-sector theory

A gravitational field with a single energetic response sector can enforce local constraint exactly and therefore closes in isolated vacuum regimes, where gravitational behaviour is fixed entirely by sources and boundary conditions.

In extended or homogeneous configurations, however, a single-sector description provides no mechanism for organising gravitational influence across space or time. Closure then fails unless additional regulating structure is introduced.

A purely single-sector gravitational field is therefore admissible only regime-by-regime. It cannot constitute a globally closed classical gravitational field.

This result accounts for the exact success of Newtonian gravity and vacuum General Relativity in isolated regimes without asserting their global completeness.

### Exclusion of three or more independent sectors

Suppose the gravitational field admitted three or more orthogonal energetic response sectors. Each sector would contribute additively to the conserved quadratic norm, while exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry requires that no unfixed regulating freedom remain.

With more than two sectors, closure would require additional constants to regulate their relative amplitudes. Such constants are not fixed by conservation laws and would reintroduce hidden degrees of freedom.

Accordingly, any gravitational field admitting three or more independent response sectors violates quadratic closure with finite conserved energy and is excluded from the admissible class.

### Forced two-sector classification

The only admissible possibility is therefore **exactly two orthogonal modes of response**.

These modes are not postulated but forced by elimination:

- one mode enforces local constraint and source response,
- one mode governs redistribution across extended spatial or temporal domains.

Any alternative description is equivalent up to representation.

### Structural significance

The two-mode classification is a consequence of closure rather than a modelling choice. It fixes the internal architecture of admissible gravitational response prior to any dynamical specification or phenomenological interpretation.

With the number and roles of admissible response sectors determined, the subsequent analysis identifies their behaviour in vacuum and non-vacuum regimes and establishes the unique covariant action consistent with closure.
