## 10 — Structural roles of the two admissible modes

The preceding classification establishes that a closed classical gravitational field admits exactly two orthogonal modes of response. We now characterise the **structural roles** of these modes. No equations of motion or geometric interpretation are introduced at this stage; the roles follow from closure, orthogonality, and exhaustion of functional freedom alone.

### Constraint (longitudinal) mode

The **constraint mode** enforces local balance between sources and gravitational response. In symmetry-reduced regimes it closes exactly, admitting no functional freedom beyond integration constants fixed by boundary conditions.

In isolated vacuum regimes, the constraint mode fully determines the gravitational field. Under symmetry reduction, all admissible degrees of freedom are exhausted, yielding rigidity and unique exterior behaviour. Newtonian gravity and vacuum General Relativity arise as necessary consequences of this closure rather than as assumed dynamics.

The defining feature of the constraint mode is locality: it governs source response and boundary-determined structure without organising influence across extended domains.

### Redistributive (transverse) mode

The **redistributive mode** governs the internal organisation of the gravitational field across extended spatial or temporal domains. It introduces no new sources and cannot act independently in isolated vacuum regimes.

Its role is purely internal. Redistribution occurs subject to global conservation and orthogonality constraints, ensuring that the redistributive response cannot be absorbed into the constraint sector or introduce independent vacuum structure.

In isolated vacuum regimes, the redistributive mode vanishes identically or reduces to pure gauge. It becomes admissible only as a controlled departure from the vacuum-closed limit, where organisation beyond local constraint is structurally required for closure.

### Structural distinction

The two modes are distinguished by function rather than by representation. The constraint mode enforces local balance and closes exactly under symmetry; the redistributive mode accommodates internal organisation where closure cannot be maintained by constraint alone.

This distinction is fixed by necessity. Any attempt to merge the roles of the two modes or to introduce additional independent response sectors violates closure or orthogonality.

With the structural roles of the two admissible modes established, the analysis proceeds to examine their behaviour in isolated vacuum regimes.
