# Interpretation FAQ

This page addresses interpretation rather than derivation.  
It clarifies what the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem does and does not require about the nature of gravity, spacetime, and fields.

Nothing on this page is an additional premise of the theorem.  
All statements here are downstream interpretations of a structural result.

---

## 1) Does the Ananke Theorem make ontological claims?

No. The theorem is a structural classification: it determines what gravitational response structures are admissible if gravity closes as a classical field with finite conserved energy. Any ontological reading is optional and secondary.

---

## 2) Does the theorem require gravity to be physically real?

Yes, but only in a limited technical sense.  
The theorem requires gravity to possess physically real degrees of freedom in the classical physics sense: non-gauge, dynamically operative, and capable of carrying conserved quantities.

It does not require gravity to be a substance, medium, or metaphysically fundamental entity.

---

## 3) What does “field” mean in this framework?

“Field” is used in the minimal classical sense: a covariant structure admitting an action, conservation laws, and well-defined degrees of freedom.

This usage does not imply a material medium or underlying mechanical substrate. It excludes only purely fictitious or bookkeeping constructions.

---

## 4) What does it mean to say gravity is polarised?

“Polarised” is a structural description.  
It means gravity admits orthogonal modes of response: a constraint (longitudinal) mode exhausted in vacuum, and a redistributive (transverse) mode admissible as a single conserved degree of freedom beyond vacuum under symmetry reduction.

This describes how gravity responds, not what it ultimately is.

---

## 5) Is the redistributive mode a new thing in reality?

The theorem requires a real degree of freedom in the physical sense: it cannot be removed by gauge choice and has observable consequences in admissible regimes.

Whether one interprets this as a component of geometry, an effective collective mode, a field excitation, or an emergent structural parameter is an interpretive choice. The theorem fixes admissibility, not metaphysics.

---

## 6) Does the framework imply spacetime is emergent?

The theorem is compatible with emergent spacetime, but does not require it.  
It is equally compatible with spacetime realism, structural realism, and conservative geometric field interpretations.

Emergence is an interpretation layered on top of the structural result.

---

## 7) Does the theorem deny the geometric nature of gravity?

No.  
It shows that pure geometry is sufficient only in vacuum. Beyond vacuum, closure requires additional response structure under symmetry reduction.

Geometry is exact in vacuum; geometry alone is insufficient in all regimes.

---

## 8) Does this contradict the conceptual foundations of General Relativity?

No.  
The theorem explains why General Relativity is rigid and exact in vacuum, while clarifying the structural assumptions required to extend gravity beyond vacuum regimes.

General Relativity appears as the equilibrium constraint sector of a closed gravitational field.

---

## 9) Does the framework claim dark matter or dark energy are illusions?

No.  
It claims that certain phenomena attributed to dark components can arise as structural consequences of gravitational closure in the relevant regimes. This is a statement about explanatory sufficiency, not about the non-existence of any new ontology.

---

## 10) Is this a unified field theory?

It is a unification of classical gravity, not a unification of all fundamental interactions.

Newtonian gravity, vacuum General Relativity, galaxy-scale dynamics, and homogeneous cosmology appear as regime-dependent expressions of a single closed classical gravitational field.

While the framework is entirely classical, the identification of a genuine transverse (redistributive) degree of freedom beyond vacuum removes a key structural obstruction to quantisation present in purely constraint-based formulations. In this sense, the theorem opens gravity to consistent quantisation in principle, though any quantum theory lies beyond its scope.

---

## 11) Does the theorem imply a preferred interpretation of time?

No.  
Although the framework distinguishes constraint and redistributive responses, it does not derive a fundamental arrow of time, thermodynamics, or a preferred temporal ontology. Such questions lie beyond the theorem.

---

## 12) Is the framework compatible with realism?

Yes.  
A realist may regard the structural constraints as describing objective features of gravitational dynamics under closure.

---

## 13) Is it compatible with instrumentalism?

Yes.  
An instrumentalist may treat the theorem as a classification of admissible effective descriptions in clean regimes, without commitment to deeper ontology.

---

## 14) What metaphysical positions does the framework require?

None.  
The theorem does not require commitment to materialism, idealism, dualism, panpsychism, substantival spacetime, or relational spacetime. All such positions are optional overlays.

---

## 15) Why include an interpretation FAQ at all?

Because structural results are often misread as ontological claims.  
This page exists to prevent category errors and to clarify what is required by the theorem versus what is optional interpretation.

---

## 16) Where should readers focus first?

- Physics FAQ — regime statements, degrees of freedom, and falsification criteria  
- Papers and DOIs — the formal theorem statements and derivations  

Interpretation is secondary to structure.

---

### Summary

The Ananke Theorem constrains what gravity can do under closure.  
It does not dictate what gravity ultimately is.

Interpretation is deliberately left open.
