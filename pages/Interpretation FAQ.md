# Interpretation FAQ

This page addresses **interpretation**, not derivation.  
It clarifies what the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem **does and does not require** about the nature of gravity, spacetime, and fields.

Nothing on this page is an additional premise of the theorem.  
All statements here are **downstream interpretations** of a structural result.

---

## 1) Does the Ananke Theorem make ontological claims?

No. The theorem is a **structural classification**: it determines what gravitational response structures are admissible *if* gravity closes as a classical field with finite conserved energy.

Any ontological reading is optional and secondary.

---

## 2) Does the theorem require gravity to be “physically real”?

Yes — in a **limited, technical sense**.

The theorem requires gravity to possess **physically real degrees of freedom** in the classical physics sense:
- non-gauge,
- dynamically operative,
- capable of carrying conserved quantities.

It does **not** require gravity to be a substance, medium, or metaphysically fundamental entity.

---

## 3) What does “field” mean in this framework?

“Field” is used in the **minimal classical sense**: a covariant structure admitting a conserved action and well-defined degrees of freedom.

This does **not** imply:
- a material medium,
- a spacetime substance,
- or an underlying mechanical ether.

It rules out only purely fictitious or purely bookkeeping constructions.

---

## 4) What does it mean to say gravity is “polarised”?

“Polarised” is a **structural description**, not a metaphysical claim.

It means gravity admits **orthogonal modes of response**:
- a **constraint (longitudinal)** mode exhausted in vacuum,
- a **redistributive (transverse)** mode admissible as a single conserved degree of freedom beyond vacuum under symmetry.

This describes how gravity responds, not what it ultimately *is*.

---

## 5) Is the redistributive mode a “new thing in reality”?

The theorem requires a **real degree of freedom** in the physical sense (it cannot be gauged away and has observable consequences in admissible regimes).

Whether one interprets this as:
- a component of geometry,
- an effective collective mode,
- a field excitation,
- or an emergent structural parameter,

is an interpretive choice. The theorem fixes **admissibility**, not metaphysics.

---

## 6) Does the framework imply spacetime is emergent?

The theorem is **compatible** with emergent spacetime, but does not require it.

It is equally compatible with:
- spacetime realism,
- emergent spacetime,
- structural realism,
- conservative geometric field interpretations.

Emergence is an **interpretation**, not a premise.

---

## 7) Does the theorem deny the geometric nature of gravity?

No.

It shows that **pure geometry is sufficient only in vacuum**.  
Beyond vacuum, closure requires additional **response structure** under symmetry reduction.

Thus:
- geometry is exact in vacuum,
- geometry alone is insufficient in all regimes.

This refines, rather than rejects, the geometric picture.

---

## 8) Does this contradict General Relativity’s conceptual foundations?

No.

The theorem explains **why** General Relativity is rigid and exact in vacuum, while clarifying the structural assumptions required to extend gravity beyond vacuum regimes.

GR appears as the **equilibrium constraint sector** of a closed gravitational field.

---

## 9) Does the theorem claim dark matter or dark energy are illusions?

No.

It claims that certain phenomena attributed to dark components can arise as **structural consequences of gravitational closure** in the relevant regimes.

This is a statement about explanatory sufficiency, not about the non-existence of any new ontology.

---

## 10) Is this a unified field theory?

It is a **unification of classical gravity**, but not a unification of all fundamental interactions.

The Ananke Theorem shows that Newtonian gravity, vacuum General Relativity, galaxy-scale dynamics, and homogeneous cosmology are regime-dependent expressions of a single closed classical gravitational field with fixed degrees of freedom.

While the framework is entirely classical, the identification of a genuine transverse (redistributive) degree of freedom beyond vacuum removes a key structural obstruction to quantisation present in purely constraint-based formulations. In this sense, the theorem opens gravity to consistent quantisation in principle, though any quantum theory lies beyond the scope of the present work.

---

## 11) Does the theorem imply a preferred interpretation of time?

No.

While the framework distinguishes constraint and redistributive responses (often associated with spatial vs temporal organisation), it does not derive:
- a fundamental arrow of time,
- thermodynamics,
- or a preferred temporal ontology.

Such questions are interpretive extensions.

---

## 12) Is the theorem compatible with realism?

Yes.

A realist may regard the structural constraints as describing objective features of the gravitational field under closure.

---

## 13) Is it compatible with instrumentalism?

Yes.

An instrumentalist may treat the theorem as a classification of admissible effective descriptions in clean regimes, without commitment to deeper ontology.

---

## 14) What metaphysical positions does this framework *not* require?

It does **not** require commitment to:
- materialism,
- idealism,
- dualism,
- panpsychism,
- substantival spacetime,
- relational spacetime.

All such positions are optional overlays.

---

## 15) Why include an Interpretation FAQ at all?

Because structural results are routinely misread as ontological claims.

This page exists to:
- prevent category errors,
- protect the physics from metaphysical overreach,
- clarify what is required versus what is optional.

---

## 16) Where should readers focus first?

- **Physics FAQ** — regime statements, degrees of freedom, falsification criteria  
- **Papers and DOIs** — formal theorem statements and derivations  

Interpretation is secondary to structure.

### Summary

> The Ananke Theorem constrains what gravity **can do** under closure.  
> It does not dictate what gravity **ultimately is**.

Interpretation is left deliberately open.
