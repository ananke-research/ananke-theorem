### The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**Author:** Simon F. Gates  
**Status:** Published preprint  
**Repository:** Zenodo  

**Abstract (informal):**  
The Ananke Theorem is a structural classification result for classical gravity. It determines the admissible internal structure of gravitational fields once closure is required: finite conserved energy under covariance, exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry, and orthogonal modes of response. The theorem establishes vacuum rigidity, uniqueness of the residual degree of freedom in non-vacuum symmetry-reduced regimes, and uniqueness of the covariant gravitational action up to equivalence.

### Versioning and canonical status

The Zenodo record is the **version of record** for citation purposes.  
Minor clarifications, formatting updates, or repository restructuring do not alter the theorem unless explicitly stated in a new Zenodo version.

All results stated in this repository are downstream restatements of the canonical paper.

### Relation to other papers in the framework

The Ananke Theorem sits within a broader but logically ordered framework:

- **Fundamental Fields Theorem**  
  Establishes gravity as the unique classical field capable of closure.

- **Phenomenological Consequences of the Ananke Theorem**  
  Derives galactic and cosmological scaling laws from the classified structure.

- **Structural Diagnostics of Gravitational Closure**  
  Develops diagnostic and falsification criteria implied by closure.

Each paper is housed in a separate repository and should be cited independently.
