# Falsifiability

This page states falsification criteria implied by gravitational closure under symmetry. It is not a phenomenological fit and it introduces no new field equations beyond those fixed by the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) framework.

The logical status is simple: if gravity closes as a classical field under the axioms, then certain structural features must hold in the corresponding regimes. If those features are violated *within the stated regime conditions*, closure is falsified as defined.

---

## 1) What “falsifiable” means here

Closure is a structural hypothesis. It is falsified if, in a regime where the closure axioms and symmetry assumptions apply, observed gravitational behaviour requires response structure that the classification forbids.

This requires careful regime matching:

- falsification must be asserted only where the relevant symmetry and isolation/stationarity/homogeneity assumptions are satisfied;  
- apparent violations may arise from symmetry breaking rather than failure of closure.

---

## 2) Regime conditions for applying diagnostics

Structural diagnostics are meaningful only when the system lies in (or is well approximated by) the relevant symmetry-reduced regime.

Typical regime conditions:

- **isolated vacuum exterior** (vacuum rigidity diagnostics);  
- **stationary symmetry-reduced extended system** (galaxy-type diagnostics);  
- **homogeneous (and isotropic) reduction** (cosmological diagnostics).

If these conditions do not hold, the theorem does not make a sharp prediction.

## 3) Vacuum falsification criteria (isolated exteriors)

In isolated, symmetry-reduced vacuum regimes, closure implies vacuum rigidity: zero residual degrees of freedom and a unique exterior response (recovering vacuum GR).

Closure is falsified if any of the following are confirmed in an isolated vacuum exterior regime:

- a second independent long-range gravitational charge or hair beyond the mass–energy content permitted by the closed vacuum sector;  
- a persistent, non-vanishing transverse/redistributive contribution in vacuum that cannot be removed by gauge or boundary conditions;  
- a vacuum exterior requiring additional free functions or additional propagating classical degrees of freedom not present in the closed vacuum sector;  
- a robust, environment-independent deviation from the inverse-square weak-field scaling in an isolated vacuum regime not attributable to symmetry breaking or non-isolation.

These are structural, not parametric, failures: they cannot be repaired by tuning constants without violating closure.

---

## 4) Non-vacuum falsification criteria (symmetry-reduced extended systems)

In non-vacuum symmetry-reduced regimes, closure admits exactly one conserved residual degree of freedom and forbids more.

Closure is falsified if a stationary, symmetry-reduced extended system requires:

- more than one independent residual gravitational degree of freedom to fit its gravitational organisation (e.g. two independent free functions, two independent long-range charges, or two independent conserved structural parameters);  
- system-dependent functional freedom that cannot be reduced to symmetry breaking or to ordinary matter distribution inputs;  
- a non-conserved residual contribution in a regime where closure predicts a conserved structural term.

Operationally: if two independent, conserved “dark-sector-like” parameters are required in the same symmetry class across systems, closure fails in that regime.

---

## 5) Galaxy-regularity diagnostics (structural corollaries)

In the stationary symmetry-reduced galaxy regime, closure implies that departures from the constraint (Newton/GR) sector organise in a rigid way, yielding characteristic scaling relations.

These relations are not *assumed* by the theorem; they are structural consequences of the admissible non-vacuum response.

Closure is challenged if, within well-controlled samples meeting the regime conditions, one finds:

- a requirement for additional, independent degrees of freedom beyond the single residual term to account for the systematics;  
- robust violations of the predicted single-parameter organisation that cannot be traced to symmetry breaking, baryonic non-equilibrium, or environmental non-isolation.

(Precise observational diagnostics and permissible symmetry-breaking loopholes are treated in the Structural Diagnostics paper.)

## 6) Cosmological falsification criteria (homogeneous reduction)

Under homogeneous (and homogeneous–isotropic) reduction, conservation over comoving three-volume enforces pressureless scaling:

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}.
$$

Closure is falsified in the homogeneous reduction regime if:

- the reduced gravitational dynamics require additional independent homogeneous degrees of freedom beyond the single admissible conserved structure;  
- a vacuum-surviving independent cosmological term must be inserted at the action level to match homogeneous dynamics within the closure regime assumptions;  
- the reduced dynamics display structural freedom incompatible with the classification (e.g. multiple independent integration constants playing the role of separate “dark sector” components in the same symmetry class).

As with all diagnostics, failure must be asserted only after confirming the regime assumptions (homogeneity, reduction validity, and correct interpretation of conserved quantities).

---

## 7) What does not count as falsification

The following do not falsify closure by themselves:

- phenomena occurring outside the stated regime conditions (strong symmetry breaking, non-stationarity, non-isolation, or complex baryonic feedback);  
- claims based on fitting functions that import extra degrees of freedom not present in the closure framework;  
- ambiguous cases where regime matching is not established.

Closure is a sharp hypothesis only where the regime is sharp.

---

## 8) Summary

Closure is falsified if, in a regime where symmetry reduction and isolation/stationarity/homogeneity apply, observed gravity requires forbidden structure:

- extra independent degrees of freedom,  
- additional long-range charges or hair in vacuum,  
- non-conserved residual terms where closure requires conservation,  
- or multiple independent “dark-sector-like” structural parameters in a single symmetry class.

If closure holds, gravity is rigid in vacuum and admits exactly one conserved residual degree of freedom beyond vacuum under symmetry reduction. *It can be no other way.*
