# Galactic regime (extended stationary systems)

This page states what gravitational closure implies for **extended, stationary, symmetry-reduced systems** such as spiral galaxies, and how the observed galaxy scaling laws arise as **structural consequences**, not phenomenological fits.

The defining result of this regime is the admission of **exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom once vacuum rigidity fails.

---

## 1) Regime definition

The galactic regime is characterised by:

- matter distributed throughout the region (non-vacuum),
- approximate stationarity (no global time evolution of the configuration),
- sufficient symmetry reduction (e.g. axial symmetry for disc galaxies),
- classical covariance and closure (finite conserved quadratic norm).

This is the minimal regime in which the vacuum constraint response alone is **insufficient** to close the field.

---

## 2) Why vacuum rigidity fails here

In vacuum exteriors, isolation and symmetry exhaust all freedom. In extended stationary systems, this is no longer true:

- matter is present at all radii,
- the system is not pointwise isolated,
- the constraint (equilibrium) response sourced by matter does not fully determine the field globally.

If gravity were forced to remain purely constraint-geometric in this regime, the field would fail to close: there would be unresolved organisation across the system.

Closure therefore **demands** an additional response — but closure also **severely constrains** what is admissible.

---

## 3) Admission of exactly one residual degree of freedom

Under the closure axioms and symmetry reduction:

- no new independent fields are permitted,
- no free functional freedom is permitted,
- no additional gravitational charges are permitted.

The classification result is sharp:

> **Exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom is admissible in extended stationary systems.  
> No more, no less.

This residual degree of freedom is not an independent field. It is the **redistributive (transverse) response mode** of the same polar gravitational field, activated only because closure requires it in this regime.

---

## 4) Orthogonality and “slaving” of the redistributive mode

The redistributive response is **orthogonal** to the constraint (longitudinal) response.

Crucially:

- it is not independently sourced,
- it is not free to vary arbitrarily,
- it is *slaved* to the constraint sector and to global conservation.

Its role is to redistribute gravitational influence across the system so that the field closes globally.

This ensures predictivity: the appearance of the residual response does not enlarge the theory’s freedom.

---

## 5) Radial geometry as the organising object

In the galactic regime, the relevant geometric object is **radius**.

Because the system is extended and stationary:

- angular and temporal dependence are symmetry-suppressed,
- organisation must occur across radius.

The single residual degree of freedom therefore appears as a **radial organising parameter**, governing how the gravitational field redistributes across the system.

This geometric fact is the origin of the observed radial scaling laws.

---

## 6) Emergence of the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation

Under closure, the radial balance between the constraint response (sourced by baryonic mass) and the redistributive response yields an asymptotic circular speed that depends only on the baryonic content.

The result is the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation:

$$
M_b \propto V^4 .
$$

This relation is not assumed, fitted, or interpolated. It follows algebraically from:

- one conserved residual degree of freedom,
- radial organisation,
- closure under symmetry.

The exponent and the tightness of the relation are fixed structurally.

---

## 7) Radial acceleration and mass discrepancy relations

The same residual degree of freedom governs the departure between observed and baryon-sourced acceleration.

This yields relations of the form:

$$
g_{\rm obs} - g_{\rm bar} \propto g_{\rm bar}^{-1/2},
$$

commonly discussed as the radial acceleration relation (RAR) or mass-discrepancy–acceleration (MDA) relation.

Within closure, these are not separate laws. They are different expressions of the **same single organising parameter** under radial symmetry.

---

## 8) Why MOND works here — and only here

Phenomenological frameworks such as MOND reproduce galaxy regularities by introducing an acceleration scale and an interpolation function.

The closure framework explains *why* such phenomenology succeeds in this regime:

- extended stationary systems admit exactly one residual organising parameter,
- radial symmetry fixes how it enters,
- no additional freedom is allowed.

MOND works because it effectively encodes this structure — but it does so phenomenologically, without a closure classification, and therefore does not extend consistently beyond this regime.

---

## 9) What is forbidden in the galactic regime

If closure holds, the following are structurally forbidden in extended stationary systems:

- more than one independent residual degree of freedom,
- environment-dependent tuning parameters,
- multiple acceleration scales,
- screening mechanisms that persist in true vacuum,
- free interpolation functions not fixed by symmetry and conservation.

Any confirmed need for such freedom would falsify closure in this regime.

---

## 10) Relation to vacuum and cosmology

The galactic regime sits between the other two regimes:

- **Vacuum:** zero residual DOF, pure constraint geometry.  
- **Galaxies:** one residual DOF organising radially.  
- **Cosmology:** the same residual DOF organising globally in time.

The continuity of the residual degree of freedom across regimes is a central result of the classification.

---

## Regime conclusion

In extended stationary systems, the constraint (equilibrium) response alone is insufficient to achieve closure. Symmetry reduction admits exactly one conserved residual degree of freedom, appearing as a redistributive response slaved to the constraint sector and organising the field radially.

The resulting galaxy scaling relations follow as algebraic consequences of closure, not as phenomenological inputs.  
***They can be no other way.***
