## 13 — Controlled departure from vacuum closure

> **PDF correspondence:** Sections 18–19 of the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem (Zenodo v1.0)

Vacuum rigidity represents the maximally closed state of the gravitational field. In isolated vacuum regimes, all admissible degrees of freedom are exhausted and the field closes exactly on its constraint sector. Non-vacuum regimes must therefore arise only as **controlled departures** from this fully constrained limit.

The question addressed here is not whether additional structure appears outside vacuum, but **how much is permitted** without violating closure.

### Transition to the non-vacuum case

Relaxing the vacuum condition while preserving sufficient spacetime symmetry alters the closure requirements. In extended or homogeneous configurations, gravity must not only enforce local constraint but also organise influence across space or time.

A purely constraint-dominated response is then insufficient for closure. Nevertheless, any additional structure must remain continuous with the vacuum-closed limit, introduce no independent vacuum degrees of freedom, and preserve finite conserved energy under symmetry reduction.

Non-vacuum behaviour is therefore admissible only insofar as it respects the primacy of vacuum closure.

### Controlled departure from the vacuum-closed limit

Vacuum closure defines a zero-degree-of-freedom baseline. Any admissible non-vacuum extension must satisfy all of the following structural requirements:

- it vanishes identically, or reduces to pure gauge, in the vacuum limit;
- it introduces no propagating degrees of freedom in vacuum;
- it preserves orthogonality and quadratic closure;
- it admits no additional universal constants or free functions;
- it remains fixed by conservation and symmetry.

These conditions ensure that non-vacuum structure does not modify or destabilise vacuum behaviour, but instead supplements it only where closure cannot otherwise be maintained.

### Structural role of non-vacuum admissibility

Non-vacuum regimes do not represent a breakdown of closure. They represent situations in which closure cannot be achieved by constraint alone and therefore requires limited internal organisation.

This organisation must be supplied by the redistributive sector identified earlier. Its admissibility, magnitude, and form are constrained entirely by continuity with the vacuum-closed limit and by the same principles that enforce vacuum rigidity.

With this framework established, the analysis proceeds to determine **how many residual degrees of freedom** may remain admissible in non-vacuum but symmetry-reduced regimes.
