## 03 — Scope and logical status

The Ananke Theorem is formulated as a **structural classification result** for classical gravity. Its scope is defined by what the theorem addresses, and equally by what it does not.

The theorem concerns the admissibility of gravitational field structures under closure. It does not propose new dynamics, introduce phenomenological parameters, or modify empirical laws. Its conclusions are derived prior to any regime-specific modelling or observational interpretation.

The logical status of the result is therefore deductive rather than heuristic. Once closure is required, the space of admissible gravitational responses is constrained exhaustively. The theorem proceeds by elimination of structurally inadmissible possibilities, not by selection among competing models.

### Domain of applicability

The theorem applies to **classical gravitational fields** subject to:

- covariance,
- finite conserved field energy,
- and internal closure.

No restriction is placed on spacetime dimension, coordinate system, or specific solution class beyond those implied by these requirements. The result is independent of particular symmetry choices; symmetry enters only at the stage of regime classification.

### Relation to existing theories

The Ananke Theorem does not compete with General Relativity or its extensions at the level of phenomenology. Instead, it clarifies the structural conditions under which such theories are admissible.

In particular, the theorem explains why certain gravitational descriptions exhibit rigidity and universality, while others require additional response. These features are shown to follow from closure and symmetry rather than from discretionary theoretical choices.

### Upstream and downstream results

The theorem occupies a precise position within a broader logical structure:

- **Upstream**, the Fundamental Fields Theorem establishes gravity as the unique classical field capable of closure.
- **Here**, the Ananke Theorem classifies the admissible internal structure of that closed gravitational field.
- **Downstream**, phenomenological scaling laws and diagnostic criteria arise as consequences of the classified structure under specific symmetry conditions.

No downstream results are invoked in the proof of the theorem itself.

### Limits of the theorem

The Ananke Theorem does not address:

- quantum gravity,
- microscopic matter structure,
- or the empirical calibration of gravitational phenomena.

Such questions lie outside its scope. The theorem establishes what gravitational field structures are *permitted* under closure, not how nature selects among them in specific physical regimes.

Within this domain, the result is complete.
