## 01 — Problem statement

Classical gravity is used in practice as though its field structure were uniquely determined: vacuum exteriors are treated as universal, the weak-field limit is taken to be fixed, and the geometric description of gravitation is applied across a wide range of regimes.

At the same time, the standard formulation leaves open structural questions that are not resolved at the level of principle:

- what it means for gravity to **close** as a classical field with finite conserved energy,
- whether gravitational dynamics admit **independent residual degrees of freedom** beyond the geometric constraint sector,
- why vacuum gravity is so rigid and universal, while extended systems exhibit organised departures commonly parameterised as “dark sector” phenomena,
- and whether the covariant action governing gravity is fixed by structural necessity or remains a matter of discretionary extension.

The Ananke programme addresses these questions by reframing the starting point. The problem is posed as a classification task:

> **Determine the admissible field structures of classical gravity once closure is required.**

Here, *closure* denotes internal completion: the gravitational field must account for its conserved energy within the field description itself, without auxiliary bookkeeping, ad hoc additional charges, or unconstrained functional freedom.

Once closure is imposed, many otherwise permissible constructions are excluded. The problem is therefore not to propose a new gravitational model, but to identify what gravitational structures remain admissible after structural impossibilities are removed.

The output of this analysis is a theorem: a classification of admissible gravitational responses and the regime-dependent exhaustion of degrees of freedom under symmetry. In particular, the classification determines when gravity reduces to pure constraint geometry, when additional response is structurally required, and how this restriction fixes the covariant gravitational action up to equivalence.
