## 10 — Two-mode structure and uniqueness

> **PDF correspondence:** Sections 10–11 of the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem (Zenodo v1.0)

The preceding classification establishes that a closed classical gravitational field admits **exactly two orthogonal modes of response**. This section characterises their structural roles and establishes the **uniqueness** of the two-mode structure.

No equations of motion, geometric identifications, or phenomenological inputs are introduced. The results follow solely from closure, orthogonality, and exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry.

### Structural roles of the two admissible modes

The two admissible modes are distinguished by **function**, not by representation.

**Constraint (longitudinal) mode.**  
The constraint mode enforces local balance between sources and gravitational response. In symmetry-reduced regimes it closes exactly, admitting no functional freedom beyond integration constants fixed by boundary conditions. In isolated vacuum regimes it fully determines the gravitational field, yielding rigidity and unique exterior behaviour. Newtonian gravity and vacuum General Relativity arise as necessary consequences of this closure rather than as assumed dynamics.

**Redistributive (transverse) mode.**  
The redistributive mode governs internal organisation of the gravitational field across extended spatial or temporal domains. It introduces no new sources and cannot act independently in isolated vacuum regimes. Its role is purely internal: redistribution subject to global conservation and orthogonality. In vacuum it vanishes identically or reduces to pure gauge, becoming admissible only as a controlled departure from the vacuum-closed limit.

### Proposition — Uniqueness of the two-mode structure

**Proposition.**  
A closed classical gravitational field satisfying Axioms I–III admits **exactly two** orthogonal modes of response: one constraint mode and one redistributive mode.

**Structural justification.**  
A single response mode enforces local constraint and therefore closes in isolated vacuum regimes, but fails to close in extended or homogeneous configurations where organisation across space or time is required. Conversely, admitting more than two independent response modes violates quadratic closure under symmetry by introducing uncontrolled residual freedom not fixed by conservation laws. Exactly two orthogonal modes satisfy all admissibility conditions simultaneously.

### Significance

The two-mode structure is not a modelling choice. It is **forced by elimination** once closure is required. The roles of the modes are fixed prior to any dynamical specification, and no alternative decomposition remains admissible.

With the two-mode structure and its uniqueness established, the analysis proceeds to examine the behaviour of this structure in isolated vacuum regimes.
