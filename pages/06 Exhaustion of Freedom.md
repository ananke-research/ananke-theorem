## 06 — Exhaustion of functional freedom

The joint imposition of classical covariance, quadratic closure, and finite conserved energy places immediate and stringent restrictions on admissible gravitational field structures. These restrictions follow directly from the axioms and do not rely on any additional dynamical input.

The central consequence is the **exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry**.

### Elimination of functional freedom under symmetry

Quadratic closure implies that, once sufficient spacetime symmetry is imposed, admissible field equations reduce to operators of fixed functional form. Orthogonality prevents deficiencies in one response sector from being absorbed by another, while covariance ensures that these restrictions are independent of coordinate choice.

Accordingly, in any sufficiently symmetric regime, admissible solutions cannot retain arbitrary functions of space or time. Any residual freedom must appear exclusively as discrete integration constants fixed by conservation laws.

This restriction is structural. It does not depend on a particular choice of field variables, representation, or equations of motion.

### Proposition — Exhaustion of residual freedom by symmetry

**Proposition.**  
Under sufficient spacetime symmetry, the gravitational field equations admit no functional degrees of freedom. Only integration constants fixed by conservation may remain.

This result follows directly from Axioms I–III once finite-energy admissibility and symmetry reduction are imposed. Any surviving functional freedom would require supplementary regulating structure, thereby violating internal closure.

### Clarification on degrees of freedom

Throughout this work, a *degree of freedom* refers exclusively to unfixed functional or parametric freedom that survives symmetry reduction and conservation, including residual integration constants. It does not refer to kinematical field components prior to the imposition of closure and admissibility.

With this convention, statements concerning zero, one, or multiple degrees of freedom are statements about what remains structurally admissible after all closure requirements are enforced.

### Structural significance

The exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry is not an auxiliary assumption. It is a direct consequence of closure and underlies all subsequent classification results.

In particular, it explains why isolated vacuum gravity exhibits rigidity and uniqueness, and why any admissible non-vacuum structure must appear only as a controlled departure from this fully constrained limit.

With functional freedom exhausted, the remaining task is to determine how many independent response modes are compatible with closure. This question is addressed next.
