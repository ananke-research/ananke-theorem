# Gravity regimes: overview

This page provides a structural overview of the **three gravitational regimes** distinguished by the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem.

The regimes are not different theories. They are **different symmetry-reduced domains** of the *same closed gravitational field*, distinguished by how many degrees of freedom remain admissible once closure and symmetry are imposed.

A key organising feature is that each regime is naturally associated with a different **geometric object** over which gravity must organise: surface area, radius, or volume.

---

## The organising principle

Gravity is required to close as a classical field with:

- classical covariance,
- a finite conserved quadratic norm,
- orthogonal modes of response.

Under symmetry reduction, these requirements **exhaust functional freedom**. What remains is a small number of admissible integration constants (degrees of freedom), whose geometric interpretation depends on the regime.

The regimes therefore differ not by dynamics added ad hoc, but by **which geometric quantity gravity must organise over** once closure is enforced.

## Summary table

| Regime | Symmetry class | Residual DOF | Dominant geometry | Organising object |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Vacuum | Isolated exterior | 0 | Surface geometry | Area |
| Galaxies | Extended stationary | 1 | Radial structure | Radius |
| Cosmology | Homogeneous–isotropic | 1 | Global evolution | Volume |

## 1) Vacuum regime — surface geometry

**Regime:** isolated vacuum exteriors  
**Residual DOF:** zero  

In the vacuum regime:

- there are no matter sources in the region,
- isolation removes external forcing,
- symmetry reduction exhausts all freedom.

Closure then forces **zero residual degrees of freedom**. The redistributive mode is forbidden, leaving only the equilibrium constraint response.

The gravitational field organises purely as **geometry**. The relevant geometric object is **surface area**, reflecting the fact that the exterior field is fully determined by boundary conditions enclosing sources.

This is the regime of vacuum General Relativity. Its rigidity is not accidental; it is the direct consequence of closure exhausting all admissible freedom.

---

## 2) Galactic regime — radial geometry

**Regime:** extended, stationary, symmetry-reduced systems  
**Residual DOF:** exactly one (conserved)

In galaxies and similar extended systems:

- matter is present throughout the region,
- the system is not isolated pointwise,
- the constraint (equilibrium) response alone is insufficient to close the field.

Closure then admits **exactly one** residual redistributive degree of freedom. No more are permitted.

Geometrically, the field must organise over **radius**. The residual degree of freedom appears as a conserved acceleration-like parameter governing radial organisation across the system.

This regime yields rigid radial scaling relations, including the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation and the radial acceleration relation. These are not new forces or substances; they are the unavoidable consequence of radial closure with one admissible degree of freedom.

---

## 3) Cosmological regime — volume geometry

**Regime:** homogeneous and isotropic  
**Residual DOF:** exactly one (the same as in galaxies)

In the cosmological regime:

- spatial inhomogeneity is removed by symmetry,
- only global evolution remains meaningful,
- the same single residual degree of freedom persists, but cannot organise radially.

Instead, it organises **temporally**, over **volume**.

The relevant geometric object is therefore **three-dimensional volume**, and closure yields a pressureless scaling law:

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}.
$$

This is the same conserved redistributive degree of freedom seen in galaxies, expressed under a different symmetry class. It appears as a global organising parameter rather than a local radial one.

---

## Geometric continuity across regimes

The regimes are not independent. They form a coherent geometric hierarchy:

- **surface area** (vacuum exteriors): geometry only, zero DOF;
- **radius** (galaxies): one DOF organising extended structure;
- **volume** (cosmology): the same DOF organising global evolution.

The dimensionality of the organising geometric object increases with the symmetry of the regime, while the number of admissible degrees of freedom remains tightly constrained.

---

## What this classification accomplishes

This regime structure explains:

- why GR is exact and rigid in vacuum,
- why galaxies exhibit tight radial scaling laws,
- why cosmology exhibits simple volume scaling,
- why no additional gravitational degrees of freedom are observed,
- why dark-sector phenomenology appears regime-dependent rather than universal.

All of this follows without introducing new substances, free functions, or unconstrained modifications.

---

## Summary

The Ananke Theorem classifies gravity not by force laws, but by **admissible response under symmetry and closure**.

Vacuum, galactic, and cosmological regimes differ only in how symmetry reduction constrains geometry. The same closed gravitational field manifests as surface geometry, radial organisation, or volume evolution depending on regime.

This classification sets the stage for the detailed regime analyses that follow.
