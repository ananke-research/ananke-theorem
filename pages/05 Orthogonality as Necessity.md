## 07 — Orthogonality as a structural necessity

This section establishes **orthogonality of independent response sectors** as a structural necessity of closure. The result completes the set of constraints required for the global classification statement presented at the end of this section. Orthogonality follows necessarily from quadratic closure and finite conserved energy, rather than by analogy with other field theories.

Having established that functional freedom is exhausted under symmetry (Section 06), we now determine the internal energetic structure admissible for a closed classical gravitational field. Quadratic closure enforces a decomposition of gravitational response into energetically independent sectors and strictly limits the number of admissible modes.

This result is deductive rather than heuristic. Orthogonality is not an assumption about dynamics or representation; it is required by closure itself.

### Quadratic closure and energetic structure

In any classical field theory governed by a quadratic action, the conserved energy defines a bilinear norm on the space of field configurations. Independent physical responses must therefore correspond to independent contributions to this norm.

Let \( F \) denote the total gravitational field response. Under quadratic closure, the conserved energy necessarily takes the schematic form,

 $$ 
\mathcal{E} = \langle F , F \rangle .
 $$

If the field admits multiple response sectors, the most general quadratic decomposition is,

 $$ 
\mathcal{E} = \langle F_L , F_L \rangle + \langle F_T , F_T \rangle + 2 \langle F_L , F_T \rangle ,
 $$

where \( F_L \) and \( F_T \) denote candidate independent responses. The cross term represents energetic exchange between sectors.

### Lemma 1 — Orthogonality is forced

**Lemma 1.**  
In a closed classical gravitational field satisfying Axioms I–III, independent physical responses must be orthogonal with respect to the quadratic field norm.

**Proof (structural).**  
If

 $$ 
\langle F_L , F_T \rangle \neq 0 ,
 $$

then energy may be transferred arbitrarily between response sectors without altering the total conserved norm. This permits one sector to compensate deficiencies in the other, reintroducing hidden functional freedom not fixed by sources or symmetry.

Such freedom violates closure. Therefore,

 $$ 
\langle F_L , F_T \rangle = 0
 $$

is required identically.

This result holds independently of field representation or dynamics. Orthogonality is a consequence of closure, not a modelling choice.

### Consequence for admissible structure

With admissible response structure fully constrained by closure, covariance, and forced orthogonality, the number and character of permissible gravitational response modes are fixed prior to any regime-specific analysis.

The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem may now be stated in consolidated form.
