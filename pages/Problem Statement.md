# Problem Statement

This page states why a structural classification theorem for gravity is relevant now.

The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem is motivated by a specific scientific situation: outside isolated vacuum regimes, modern gravitational phenomenology is dominated by regularities and “missing components” that are not explained structurally by the classical theory taken as universally complete.

---

## 1) What is the problem?

General Relativity (GR) is extraordinarily successful in isolated vacuum regimes and in many precision tests. Yet when gravity is applied to extended non-vacuum systems, the standard framework typically requires additional postulates to account for observed organisation.

Two broad symptoms dominate:

- **the dark sector in astrophysics and cosmology**, introduced to reconcile gravitational dynamics with observations;  
- **the proliferation of modified-gravity proposals**, introduced to reproduce empirical regularities without dark matter.

Both symptoms indicate the same underlying issue: outside vacuum, gravity is not treated as a closed field with its own admissible degrees of freedom. Instead, closure is typically supplied externally by adding new substances or new freedom.

---

## 2) The dark sector as an effective closure device

In the standard cosmological model, galaxy dynamics and cosmological acceleration are addressed by introducing:

- **dark matter**, to supply additional gravitational influence in galaxies and large-scale structure;  
- **dark energy** (often encoded as a cosmological constant), to account for late-time acceleration.

These components are widely used because they are empirically effective within the model. The problem is not that the model “fits”; the problem is that the model achieves fit by adding entities whose role is to supply the missing organisation.

Structurally, the dark sector functions as an external bookkeeping layer: it provides the degrees of freedom needed to make the gravitational field behave as if it were already closed in non-vacuum regimes.

---

## 3) Empirical regularities suggest structure, not freedom

A striking feature of galaxy phenomenology is the appearance of rigid scaling relations with small scatter. Examples include:

- baryonic scaling of asymptotic rotation speed, often expressed as

$$
M_b \propto V^4,
$$

- tight relations between observed acceleration and baryonic acceleration.

Regardless of interpretation, such regularities suggest that gravitational organisation in these regimes is not arbitrary. The phenomenology looks more like a constrained response of the field than an unconstrained distribution of independent dark components.

This motivates a structural question: *what response structures are admissible if gravity is required to close as a field rather than being completed externally?*

---

## 4) Modified gravity proliferates because the degrees of freedom are not classified

Modified-gravity programmes typically attempt to reproduce galaxy regularities by altering field equations, adding extra fields, or introducing new functions.

A persistent difficulty is underconstraint: once functional freedom is permitted, many models can be constructed to mimic the same data. Predictivity then depends on additional choices (screening mechanisms, environmental dependence, interpolating functions, or free functional forms).

This is not primarily a technical failure; it is a structural one. Without a prior admissibility classification, “modifying gravity” becomes an open-ended search in an unbounded model space.

The Ananke Theorem addresses this by asking the prior question: *what is admissible at all* under closure, before any phenomenology is discussed.

---

## 5) Why a theorem, not a model?

The goal is not to propose yet another effective modification. It is to determine whether gravity has a uniquely admissible closed structure under minimal classical requirements.

A theorem is relevant because it can:

- eliminate large classes of non-closed proposals in one step;  
- explain why GR is uniquely rigid in vacuum;  
- determine how many degrees of freedom can appear beyond vacuum under symmetry reduction;  
- convert “why does MOND work?”-type questions into structural regime statements rather than phenomenological coincidences.

In short: it moves the discussion upstream, from fitting to admissibility.

---

## 6) The structural question the theorem answers

The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem asks:

If gravity is a classical field, covariant, with finite conserved quadratic norm, and if its response decomposes into orthogonal modes, what gravitational response structures are admissible once the field is required to close under symmetry reduction?

This is a well-posed classification problem. The answer is a constraint on the space of possible classical gravities.

---

## 7) What the theorem resolves (in framing terms)

At the level of framing, the theorem resolves the following:

- why GR is exact in isolated vacuum exteriors (vacuum rigidity);  
- why additional independent gravitational charges or screening mechanisms are forbidden in vacuum under closure;  
- why non-vacuum symmetry-reduced extended systems admit exactly one conserved residual degree of freedom, and no more;  
- why rigid scaling relations can arise as structural consequences rather than phenomenological “laws of nature” requiring new substances.

This does not remove the need for empirical testing. It does remove the need to treat non-vacuum organisation as an open-ended modelling exercise.

---

## 8) What remains empirical

A structural theorem does not replace observation. It determines what should be looked for and what cannot occur if closure holds.

Empirically, one must still establish:

- whether real systems satisfy the symmetry and regime assumptions closely enough for the classification to apply;  
- whether the predicted single-parameter organisation holds across samples;  
- whether any forbidden structures are observed in regimes where closure should be sharp.

These are addressed downstream in the diagnostics and phenomenology papers.

---

## Summary

The modern situation is not simply “GR fails”. It is that outside vacuum, gravity is not treated as a fully closed field; closure is supplied externally by dark components or by enlarged model spaces.

The Ananke Theorem is relevant because it addresses the upstream structural question: if gravity must close, what response structure is admissible, and how many degrees of freedom can appear in each regime?

*It can be no other way.*
