## 00 — Overview

The **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem** establishes a foundational structural result for classical gravity.  
It determines what gravitational field structures are admissible *in principle* once gravity is required to close as a classical field with finite conserved energy under covariance.

The theorem does not introduce new dynamics, phenomenological fits, or additional matter content.  
Instead, it classifies the possible forms gravity may take by eliminating structures that fail to satisfy closure.

The central result is that closure imposes strict and exhaustive constraints on the gravitational field.  
Under these constraints, gravity is not characterised by geometry alone, nor by arbitrary additional fields, but by **orthogonal modes of response** whose admissibility is fixed by structural necessity.

### Logical status

The Ananke Theorem is a **classification theorem**, not a model proposal.  
Its conclusions follow deductively from the requirement that gravity form a closed classical field under symmetry and covariance.

No observational inputs are used.  
No phenomenological parameters are introduced.  
No empirical tuning is performed.

The theorem answers a single question:

> *What gravitational field structures are admissible once closure is required?*

### Closure as the organising principle

Closure is defined as the requirement that the gravitational field account fully for its own conserved energy without external bookkeeping, auxiliary fields, or unbalanced degrees of freedom.

When this requirement is imposed, many otherwise permissible constructions are eliminated.  
The remaining admissible structures are fixed not by choice, but by exhaustion of alternatives.

Closure therefore acts as a **selection principle**, determining the internal structure of gravity independently of empirical detail.

### Axiomatic minimality

The theorem proceeds from a minimal set of axioms expressing:

1. Classical covariance,
2. Quadratic closure with finite conserved field norm,
3. Orthogonal modes of response.

These axioms are not specialised to any particular gravitational theory.  
They express general structural requirements shared by classical field descriptions.

All subsequent results follow from these axioms through elimination and classification.

### Exhaustion of degrees of freedom

A central result of the theorem is that symmetry reduction exhausts available degrees of freedom.

- In isolated vacuum regimes, closure and symmetry eliminate all residual freedom.
- In non-vacuum, symmetry-reduced regimes, exactly one residual degree of freedom remains admissible.

No further independent gravitational degrees of freedom are permitted without violating closure.

This result is structural and does not depend on specific field equations.

---

### Orthogonality as necessity

The theorem demonstrates that admissible gravitational responses must decompose into **orthogonal sectors**.

This orthogonality is not imposed as a postulate.  
It is required to maintain closure while accommodating both local constraint and global redistribution.

The familiar geometric sector of gravity emerges as one such response mode; additional response is permitted only where closure demands it.

---

### Regime classification

The theorem classifies gravitational behaviour by regime:

- **Vacuum regimes** admit no residual degrees of freedom and are rigid.
- **Symmetry-reduced non-vacuum regimes** admit exactly one redistributive degree of freedom.

This classification explains why gravitational behaviour appears universal in vacuum yet structured in extended systems, without invoking additional substances or arbitrary modifications.

### Unique action

Collecting the admissible structures, the theorem determines the **covariant gravitational action uniquely up to equivalence**, modulo boundary terms and field redefinitions.  
Any omission renders the admissible action incomplete.  
Any addition introduces forbidden independent degrees of freedom.

The familiar Einstein–Hilbert sector is recovered as the unique vacuum expression of the closed gravitational field.

### Downstream consequences

Phenomenological scaling laws, cosmological behaviour, and diagnostic criteria do not enter the theorem itself.  
They arise downstream as consequences of the classified structure under specific symmetry conditions.

These consequences are treated in separate works and repositories.
