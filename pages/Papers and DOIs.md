## Fundamental Fields Theorem

**Title:** *The Fundamental Fields Theorem*  

This paper establishes an upstream classification result: which classical interaction fields are capable of closing under covariance and finite conserved energy. It identifies gravity as uniquely admissible.

**DOI:**  
https://zenodo.org/records/18387035

## Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**Title:** *Ananke: A Classification Theorem for Closed Classical Gravity*  

This is the core theorem. It classifies the admissible structure of classical gravity under closure, deriving the unique covariant action, exact GR recovery in vacuum, and the existence of a single redistributive degree of freedom outside vacuum.

**DOI:**  
https://zenodo.org/records/18387510

## Structural Diagnostics of Gravitational Closure

**Title:** *Structural Diagnostics of Gravitational Closure*  

This paper translates the classification results into necessary and forbidden observational signatures, providing falsification criteria for gravitational closure under symmetry reduction.

**DOI:**  
https://zenodo.org/records/18387629

## Phenomenological Consequences of the Ananke Theorem

**Title:** *Phenomenological Consequences of the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem*  

This work derives the galaxy and cosmological scaling laws (BTFR, RAR/MDA, pressureless cosmological scaling) as algebraic consequences of closure, without additional matter components or free parameters.
