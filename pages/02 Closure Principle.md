## 02 — Closure principle

The organising principle of the Ananke Theorem is **closure**.

Closure is the requirement that the gravitational field form a complete classical system: its dynamics must account fully for the field’s conserved energy within the field description itself, without recourse to external bookkeeping, auxiliary structures, or unconstrained residual degrees of freedom.

This requirement is structural rather than phenomenological. It is imposed prior to any choice of field equations, symmetry assumptions, or empirical input. Closure concerns what is admissible *in principle*, not what is observed in a particular regime.

A classical field fails to close if any of the following occur:

- conserved energy cannot be expressed entirely in terms of the field variables,
- additional degrees of freedom must be introduced ad hoc to stabilise the dynamics,
- residual functional freedom remains after symmetry reduction,
- or external constraints are required to enforce consistency.

Closure excludes such constructions by definition.

When closure is enforced, gravitational dynamics are no longer freely extensible. Field structures that appear formally covariant may nevertheless be inadmissible if they introduce independent degrees of freedom not fixed by conservation.

Closure therefore acts as a selection principle. It determines which gravitational responses may exist and how they may be organised, independently of empirical fitting or model preference.

The Ananke Theorem applies this principle to classical gravity and derives its consequences exhaustively. All subsequent results follow from the interaction of closure with covariance and symmetry, rather than from additional physical assumptions.
