## 15 — Slaving, conservation, and non-vacuum admissibility

> **PDF correspondence:** Sections 22–24 of the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem (Zenodo v1.0)

The preceding classification establishes that exactly one residual degree of freedom is admissible in non-vacuum, symmetry-reduced regimes, and that it cannot exist as an independent fundamental field. We now determine **how this residual structure may be realised** without violating closure.

The answer is fixed by elimination: the residual degree of freedom must be *slaved* to the constraint sector and governed by conservation alone.

### Forced slaving of the redistributive mode

Any admissible residual structure must reside entirely within the redistributive sector. Independence is forbidden: an independently dynamical scalar or vector field would either persist in vacuum or introduce propagating vacuum modes, both of which violate vacuum rigidity.

The only admissible possibility is therefore that the redistributive mode is **constructed from the constraint sector itself**, together with a direction field whose freedom is fixed by symmetry rather than by dynamics.

Formally, the redistributive potential must take the composite form,

 $$ 
A_\mu = \phi\,u_\mu ,
 $$

where \( \phi \) denotes the scalar associated with the constraint sector and \( u_\mu \) is a unit or tangent field encoding the direction of redistribution.

No alternative construction satisfies closure, orthogonality, and vacuum rigidity simultaneously.

### Conservation and the continuity constraint

Redistribution must occur without creation or destruction of the scalar content it transports. Global conservation therefore imposes a continuity-type constraint.

The slaved redistributive mode must satisfy,

 $$ 
\nabla_\mu(\phi\,u^\mu) = 0 .
 $$

This condition is the unique covariant expression of redistribution without creation compatible with quadratic closure and finite conserved energy. Any alternative would introduce sources, sinks, or additional regulating structure, thereby violating closure.

### Summary of non-vacuum admissibility

In non-vacuum symmetry-reduced regimes:

- exactly one residual degree of freedom is admissible;
- it resides entirely within the redistributive sector;
- it cannot appear as an independent field;
- it must be slaved to the constraint sector;
- its behaviour is fixed by conservation and symmetry alone.

With these conditions enforced, the admissible form of non-vacuum gravitational structure is fully determined at the level of response classification.

### Significance

Slaving and conservation complete the non-vacuum classification. No further structural freedom remains. The remaining task is to assemble the **unique covariant gravitational action** consistent with closure, orthogonality, vacuum rigidity, and the admissible form of residual structure.

This construction is carried out next.
