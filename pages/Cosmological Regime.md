# Cosmological regime (homogeneous–isotropic systems)

This page states what gravitational closure implies in the **homogeneous–isotropic cosmological regime**, and why the same single residual degree of freedom admitted in galaxies reappears here as a **global, time-organising response** rather than a radial one.

The result is a pressureless volume scaling that is structurally fixed, not postulated.

---

## 1) Regime definition

The cosmological regime is defined by:

- non-vacuum matter content,
- **homogeneity and isotropy** (no preferred location or direction),
- absence of meaningful radial structure,
- classical covariance and closure (finite conserved quadratic norm).

Symmetry reduction here is stronger than in galaxies: all spatial structure is removed by symmetry reduction.

---

## 2) What changes relative to galaxies

In galaxies, the residual degree of freedom organises **radially** because radius is the only remaining geometric coordinate.

In cosmology:

- radial organisation is eliminated by homogeneity,
- angular organisation is eliminated by isotropy,
- only **global evolution** remains admissible.

Crucially, the **number of admissible residual degrees of freedom does not increase**. The same single conserved redistributive degree of freedom persists, but its geometric expression changes.

---

## 3) Volume as the organising geometric object

With spatial structure removed, the relevant geometric object is **three-dimensional volume**.

Closure therefore requires the residual degree of freedom to organise the gravitational field **over volume in time**, rather than over radius in space.

This is the cosmological analogue of the galactic radial organisation.

---

## 4) Emergence of pressureless scaling

Under these symmetry conditions, closure yields a conserved matter density that scales with volume:

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3}.
$$

This is the defining result of the cosmological regime.

Within the closure framework, this scaling:

- is not assumed as “dust”,
- is not derived from microscopic particle kinematics,
- does not require an expanding-space ontology.

It follows from conservation and symmetry once the residual degree of freedom is required to organise globally.

---

## 5) Interpretation of the residual degree of freedom

The redistributive response:

- is the **same mode** admitted in the galactic regime,
- remains orthogonal to the constraint (equilibrium) sector,
- is conserved and slaved to global closure.

In cosmology, it manifests as a uniform organising influence governing how total matter content is distributed over volume in time.

This explains why cosmological dynamics appear simple and highly constrained despite vast scales.

---

## 6) Relation to standard cosmological equations

In standard treatments, pressureless scaling is often introduced as a matter assumption (“dust”) and embedded within a spacetime-expansion framework.

In closure language, the same mathematical form appears for a different reason:

- the redistributive degree of freedom enforces global closure,
- homogeneity and isotropy eliminate spatial structure,
- conservation fixes the scaling uniquely.

The familiar Friedmann-like form is therefore recovered as a **structural consequence**, not a cosmological postulate.

---

## 7) Why no additional cosmological degrees of freedom appear

Closure forbids:

- multiple independent cosmological acceleration parameters,
- time-dependent gravitational charges,
- environment-dependent cosmological responses,
- independent “dark energy” fields introduced solely to organise expansion.

Any additional freedom would violate the admissibility classification under symmetry.

The appearance of a single organising parameter is therefore maximal and final within this regime.

---

## 8) Continuity with vacuum and galaxies

The three regimes form a continuous hierarchy:

- **Vacuum:** zero residual DOF; pure constraint geometry; surface organisation.  
- **Galaxies:** one residual DOF; radial organisation.  
- **Cosmology:** the same residual DOF; volume organisation in time.

No regime introduces new independent gravitational structure.

---

## 9) Diagnostic content

If closure holds in the cosmological regime, the following are structurally required:

- pressureless volume scaling under homogeneity and isotropy,
- a single conserved organising parameter,
- absence of additional long-range gravitational degrees of freedom.

Conversely, confirmed evidence for multiple independent cosmological organising parameters would falsify closure in this domain.

---

## Regime conclusion

Under homogeneity and isotropy, spatial organisation is eliminated by symmetry reduction. The same single conserved residual degree of freedom admitted in extended systems can therefore organise only over volume in time.

Closure uniquely fixes the pressureless scaling

$$
\rho \propto a^{-3},
$$

as the global organising response of the gravitational field.  
The scaling relation is therefore **'Ananke'**: ***It can be no other way.***
