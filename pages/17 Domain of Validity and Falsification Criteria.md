## 17 — Domain of validity and falsification criteria

> **PDF correspondence:** Section 26 of the Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem (Zenodo v1.0)

The Ananke Theorem is a structural classification result. Its validity and falsifiability are therefore determined by the conditions under which its axioms apply and by the consequences that must follow if closure holds.

This section delineates the **domain of validity** of the theorem and specifies the **criteria by which it may be falsified**.

### Domain of validity

The theorem applies to **classical gravitational fields** that satisfy all of the following conditions:

- a generally covariant formulation exists;
- the gravitational field admits a quadratic conserved energy functional;
- closure is required, in the sense that no auxiliary bookkeeping, hidden regulators, or unfixed functional freedom is permitted;
- admissible degrees of freedom are exhausted under symmetry reduction.

Within this domain, the classification results—vacuum rigidity, residual uniqueness, and action uniqueness—follow necessarily.

The theorem does not apply to regimes in which any of these conditions fail, including quantum gravitational dynamics, microscopic matter structure, or explicitly non-classical descriptions.

### Structural falsification

Because the theorem introduces no phenomenological parameters, it cannot be falsified by parameter fitting or empirical mismatch at the level of specific models. Instead, falsification is **structural**.

The Ananke Theorem is falsified if any of the following are demonstrated within its domain of validity:

1. **Existence of additional admissible degrees of freedom**  
   Observation or construction of a closed classical gravitational field exhibiting more than one residual degree of freedom in a symmetry-reduced non-vacuum regime.

2. **Failure of vacuum rigidity**  
   Existence of propagating, finite-energy gravitational degrees of freedom in isolated vacuum regimes not removable by gauge or boundary conditions.

3. **Non-uniqueness of the admissible action**  
   Construction of a covariant gravitational action satisfying closure, orthogonality, and vacuum rigidity that is not equivalent to the classified action.

4. **Violation of orthogonality under closure**  
   Demonstration that independent gravitational response sectors may exchange energy while preserving closure and finite conserved energy.

Any one of these would contradict the classification and falsify the theorem.

### Non-falsifying observations

The following do **not** falsify the theorem:

- deviations from vacuum behaviour in non-isolated or symmetry-broken regimes;
- apparent additional structure arising from environmental dependence or symmetry breaking;
- phenomenological modifications that can be traced to the single admissible residual degree of freedom;
- reinterpretations of known solutions within the classified structure.

Such effects lie downstream of the theorem and are addressed by regime-specific analyses.

### Epistemic status

The Ananke Theorem makes no empirical predictions by itself. It constrains what gravitational structures are admissible *in principle* under closure. Empirical content enters only when the classified structure is applied to specific physical regimes.

Within its domain of validity, the theorem is exact. Outside that domain, it makes no claim.

This completes the structural classification.
