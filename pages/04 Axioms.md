## 04 — Primitive axioms

The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem proceeds from a minimal set of **primitive axioms**.  
These axioms are purely structural. They do not specify a gravitational model, geometric ansatz, or particle ontology. Their sole role is to delimit the admissible class of closed classical gravitational fields.

No axiom introduces phenomenological content or regime-dependent assumptions. Each expresses a necessary condition for closure.

### Axiom I — Classical covariance

Gravity is described by a classical physical field admitting a generally covariant formulation.  
Admissible structures are invariant under diffeomorphisms and require the existence of a covariant variational description,

 $$ 
S[\Psi] = \int \mathcal{L}(\Psi,\nabla\Psi)\,\sqrt{-g}\,d^4x ,
 $$

whose physical content is independent of coordinate choice.

This axiom asserts physical equivalence under diffeomorphisms. It does not require the fundamental field variables to be identified with a metric, a connection, or any specific geometric object, nor does it presuppose a particular interpretation of spacetime.

Classical covariance ensures that all admissibility statements derived in the theorem are representation-independent.

### Axiom II — Quadratic closure

The gravitational field requires the existence of a quadratic action with a finite conserved bilinear field norm.  
Admissibility therefore requires the existence of a quadratic functional,

 $$ 
\mathcal{Q}[\Psi] = \langle \Psi, \Psi \rangle ,
 $$

which is finite on admissible configurations and conserved,

 $$ 
\delta \mathcal{Q} = 0 .
 $$

Quadratic closure enforces additive energetic bookkeeping between independent response components and guarantees exhaustion of functional freedom under symmetry reduction. Admissible solutions may retain only discrete integration constants fixed by conservation laws; no free functions of space or time are permitted.

Any non-quadratic contribution generically introduces additional dynamical scales, higher-order propagating structure, or implicit regime-dependent renormalisation. Such terms reintroduce independent degrees of freedom not fixed by symmetry or conservation and are therefore inadmissible.

### Axiom III — Orthogonal modes of response

The gravitational field requires the existence of orthogonal modes of response with respect to the quadratic field norm.  
For any admissible decomposition,

 $$ 
\Psi = \sum_i \Psi_i ,
 $$

orthogonality requires

 $$ 
\langle \Psi_i , \Psi_j \rangle = 0 \quad \text{for } i \neq j .
 $$

Under closure, the minimal admissible content consists of a constraint mode enforcing local balance and a redistributive mode governing internal organisation across extended domains. Orthogonality forbids redistribution from being absorbed into the constraint sector and fixes independent energetic bookkeeping between modes.

This structure follows from necessity rather than from any particular dynamical realisation.

### Remarks on logical role

The axioms are logically independent but jointly restrictive. When imposed together, they sharply constrain admissible gravitational field structures before any equations of motion or regime-specific analysis is introduced.

All subsequent results of the theorem follow deductively from Axioms I–III through elimination of structurally inadmissible possibilities.
