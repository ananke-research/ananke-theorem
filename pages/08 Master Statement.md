## 08 — The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem — Master Statement

Under the axioms of classical covariance, quadratic closure with finite conserved energy, and orthogonal modes of response:

1. **Vacuum rigidity:**  
   In isolated vacuum regimes, the gravitational field admits zero residual degrees of freedom. Closure is exact, exterior solutions are unique, and Newtonian gravity and General Relativity are recovered necessarily.

2. **Residual uniqueness:**  
   In non-vacuum but symmetry-reduced regimes, closure admits exactly one residual degree of freedom. This degree of freedom is redistributive rather than sourcing, introduces no independent vacuum modes or universal constants, and is uniquely constrained by conservation and orthogonality.

3. **Action uniqueness:**  
   The admissible covariant gravitational action is unique up to equivalence. Field content, interaction structure, and matter coupling are fixed by structural necessity rather than modelling choice.

No phenomenological input or observational constraint is required at any stage.
