# Relation to Existing Gravity Theorems

This page explains how the **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem** relates to established theorems in gravitational physics, what those theorems individually establish, and why none of them explains the others. It also clarifies the specific sense in which Ananke fills a gap that no existing theorem addresses.

The Ananke Theorem is not a competing model and does not re-derive known results. It is a **structural classification theorem**: it determines what gravitational response structures are admissible in principle once gravity is required to close as a classical field. From this perspective, many familiar gravity theorems appear as regime-specific manifestations of a deeper closure requirement.

## A Shared Feature of Existing Gravity Theorems

Modern gravitational physics contains many powerful theorems. However, they share an important limitation:

- Each theorem applies to a **specific regime**, symmetry, or formulation.
- Each is proved **independently**, using different assumptions and techniques.
- None explains *why* the others exist.
- None specifies **when General Relativity must fail**.

They are therefore best understood as **standalone rigidity and uniqueness results**, not as consequences of a single underlying principle.

## Lovelock’s Theorem (Action Uniqueness)

**What it establishes**

Lovelock’s theorem classifies all diffeomorphism-invariant, local metric actions whose field equations are second order in derivatives of the metric. In four spacetime dimensions, the result is that—up to boundary terms and a cosmological constant—the Einstein–Hilbert action is essentially unique.

This explains why most modifications of the gravitational action either do nothing dynamically or introduce higher-derivative equations and additional degrees of freedom.

**Why it does not explain other theorems**

Lovelock’s theorem:
- assumes metric gravity and an action principle,
- operates entirely at the level of the Lagrangian,
- does not address vacuum rigidity, solution uniqueness, or extended systems.

**How Ananke explains its result**

The Ananke Theorem shows that gravity must be rigid in isolated vacuum regimes if it is to close as a classical field. Any admissible action must encode that rigidity. Lovelock’s theorem can therefore be understood as the *action-level expression* of a deeper structural necessity identified by Ananke.

Lovelock explains *how* rigidity is implemented in four dimensions; Ananke explains *why* rigidity must exist at all.

## Birkhoff’s Theorem (Vacuum Rigidity)

**What it establishes**

Birkhoff’s theorem states that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the Einstein equations is necessarily static and uniquely determined by a single parameter. Interior time dependence does not affect the exterior vacuum field.

This result implies an extreme rigidity of vacuum gravity.

**Why it does not explain other theorems**

Birkhoff’s theorem:
- is a solution-level result,
- applies only within General Relativity,
- relies on a specific symmetry and field equations.

It does not explain why gravity should be rigid, nor whether this rigidity is accidental or necessary.

**How Ananke explains its result**

The Ananke Theorem shows that in isolated vacuum regimes, symmetry exhaustion leaves **zero residual degrees of freedom**. Once this happens, no dynamical structure can remain. Birkhoff-type rigidity is therefore unavoidable in any closed classical gravity theory, not just in GR.

From the Ananke perspective, Birkhoff’s theorem is not surprising; it is required.

## No-Hair Theorems (Degree-of-Freedom Exhaustion)

**What they establish**

The no-hair theorems show that stationary black holes are fully characterised by a small number of conserved quantities. All other information about the collapse process is absent from the exterior gravitational field.

This represents an extreme form of information loss and rigidity.

**Why they do not explain other theorems**

No-hair theorems:
- apply only to black holes,
- assume stationarity and regular horizons,
- are silent about non-black-hole systems or extended matter distributions.

They do not explain why such exhaustion of degrees of freedom occurs in the first place.

**How Ananke explains their result**

Ananke identifies no-hair behaviour as a special case of a general rule: when symmetry and isolation exhaust the admissible degrees of freedom, only conserved integration constants may remain. Black holes simply realise this condition in its most extreme form.

No-hair theorems are therefore object-level manifestations of a field-level closure principle.

## ADM Charges and Global Conserved Quantities

**What they establish**

The ADM formalism defines conserved quantities such as mass and momentum at spatial infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These quantities characterise the entire gravitational configuration.

**Why they do not explain other theorems**

ADM results:
- define conserved charges,
- but do not explain why *only* these charges matter,
- nor why no additional structure survives at infinity.

**How Ananke explains their result**

Under closure, once functional degrees of freedom are exhausted, only global integration constants remain. ADM charges are precisely these residual constants. Their existence and sufficiency follow naturally from closure, rather than being additional assumptions.

---

## Positive Energy Theorems

**What they establish**

Positive energy theorems show that, under reasonable conditions, total gravitational energy is non-negative and vanishes only for flat spacetime.

**Why they do not explain other theorems**

These theorems:
- ensure stability,
- but do not classify degrees of freedom,
- nor explain rigidity or uniqueness.

**How Ananke explains their role**

Closure requires a finite conserved field norm and excludes pathological configurations. Flat spacetime as the unique zero-energy state is consistent with closure eliminating spurious or negative-energy degrees of freedom.

---

## Weinberg-Type No-Go Theorems (Vacuum Energy)

**What they establish**

Weinberg’s no-go arguments show that vacuum energy cannot dynamically self-adjust without fine-tuning or additional structure.

**Why they do not explain other theorems**

They are problem-specific and do not classify gravity by regime or symmetry.

**How Ananke explains their result**

Ananke shows that vacuum-persistent structure is inadmissible under closure. Any cosmological effect must arise as an integration constant under symmetry, not as a vacuum substance. Weinberg-type no-go results reflect attempts to violate this constraint.

---

## What No Existing Theorem Does

No existing theorem in gravitational physics:

- specifies **when** General Relativity must hold and **when** it must fail,
- distinguishes vacuum from extended non-vacuum regimes structurally,
- counts admissible degrees of freedom under symmetry exhaustion,
- or explains why GR is exact in vacuum yet systematically incomplete in galaxies and cosmology.

The absence of such a theorem is why dark matter and dark energy were introduced phenomenologically rather than derived structurally.

---

## What the Ananke Theorem Adds

The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem fills this gap.

It classifies gravity by regime and symmetry and proves that:
- isolated vacuum regimes admit zero residual degrees of freedom (GR exact);
- non-vacuum, symmetry-reduced regimes admit exactly one residual conserved degree of freedom;
- no additional structure is admissible without violating closure.

In doing so, Ananke explains why established gravity theorems exist, why they are all rigidity results, and why none of them addresses the failure regime of General Relativity.

---

## Summary

Existing gravity theorems are independent results proved within specific frameworks. They do not explain one another, and none identifies the boundary of validity of General Relativity.

The Ananke Theorem provides a unifying structural explanation: it identifies the closure principle that underlies these results and uniquely specifies where gravitational rigidity must end.

It therefore complements, rather than replaces, the established theorems—by explaining the deeper necessity they all express.
