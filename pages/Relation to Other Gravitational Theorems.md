# Relation to Existing Gravity Theorems

This page describes how the **Ananke Theorem** relates to several well-established theorems in gravitational physics. Each of these results addresses a well-defined question within a particular formulation, symmetry class, or physical regime.

The Ananke Theorem addresses a different type of question: it characterises the admissible response structure of gravity once it is required to close as a classical field. From this perspective, familiar gravity theorems can be viewed as precise results obtained under specific assumptions and conditions, while Ananke concerns the general constraints that apply across regimes.

Established gravity theorems are typically formulated at the level of actions, solutions, or conserved quantities. The Ananke Theorem operates at the level of closure and degree-of-freedom admissibility. This difference in scope allows their results to be discussed together without modifying or reinterpreting their original statements.

## Complementary Roles of Gravity Theorems

Established gravity theorems typically share the following features:

- each is formulated within a specific framework (e.g. metric gravity, canonical gravity, black hole spacetimes);
- each addresses a well-defined regime or symmetry class;
- each provides a rigorous and often highly nontrivial result within that domain.

What they do **not aim to do** is provide a global classification of gravity across all regimes or to specify, in general terms, when different gravitational behaviours must arise. That broader classificatory question is the domain of the Ananke Theorem.

## Lovelock’s Theorem (Action-Level Uniqueness)

**What it establishes**

Lovelock’s theorem classifies diffeomorphism-invariant, local metric actions with second-order field equations. In four spacetime dimensions, it shows that—up to boundary terms and a cosmological constant—the Einstein–Hilbert action is essentially unique.

This result explains why many higher-curvature modifications of the gravitational action either introduce additional degrees of freedom or become dynamically trivial.

**Relation to Ananke**

Lovelock’s theorem operates at the level of admissible *actions*.  
The Ananke Theorem operates at the level of admissible *response structure* required for closure.

From the Ananke perspective, the rigidity of vacuum gravity is structurally required once closure is imposed. Lovelock’s theorem then identifies how that rigidity is realised within an action-based, metric formulation in four dimensions. The two results are therefore complementary: one constrains form, the other constrains necessity.

## Birkhoff’s Theorem (Vacuum Rigidity)

**What it establishes**

Birkhoff’s theorem shows that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the Einstein equations is necessarily static and uniquely determined by a single parameter. Interior time dependence does not affect the exterior vacuum geometry.

This is one of the clearest demonstrations of vacuum rigidity in General Relativity.

**Relation to Ananke**

Birkhoff’s theorem is a solution-level result within GR.  
The Ananke Theorem provides a field-level explanation for why such rigidity is expected: in isolated vacuum regimes, symmetry exhaustion leaves no admissible residual degrees of freedom. Under these conditions, rigidity is unavoidable.

Birkhoff’s theorem can thus be viewed as a concrete realisation of this general principle in a particular symmetry class.

## No-Hair Theorems (Exhaustion of Exterior Degrees of Freedom)

**What they establish**

The no-hair theorems show that stationary black holes are fully characterised by a small set of conserved quantities, with no additional independent parameters appearing in the exterior gravitational field.

**Relation to Ananke**

No-hair theorems apply to a specific class of objects under strong symmetry and regularity assumptions. The Ananke Theorem generalises the underlying idea: when symmetry and isolation exhaust the admissible degrees of freedom, only conserved integration constants may remain.

From this viewpoint, no-hair behaviour is not unique to black holes, but an instance of a more general closure principle.

## ADM Charges and Global Conserved Quantities

**What they establish**

The ADM formalism defines conserved quantities such as total mass and momentum for asymptotically flat spacetimes, providing a global characterisation of gravitational configurations.

**Relation to Ananke**

Under closure, once functional degrees of freedom are exhausted, gravity may depend only on global conserved quantities. ADM charges can be understood as precisely these residual constants, arising naturally once closure and asymptotic isolation are imposed.

---

## Positive Energy Theorems

**What they establish**

Positive energy theorems show that, under appropriate conditions, the total gravitational energy is non-negative and vanishes only for flat spacetime.

**Relation to Ananke**

Closure requires a finite, well-defined conserved field norm. The positivity of gravitational energy is consistent with this requirement and with the identification of flat spacetime as the unique zero-energy configuration once all admissible degrees of freedom are exhausted.

---

## Weinberg-Type No-Go Results (Vacuum Energy)

**What they establish**

Weinberg’s no-go arguments show that vacuum energy cannot dynamically self-adjust without fine-tuning or additional structure.

**Relation to Ananke**

The Ananke Theorem identifies vacuum-persistent structure as inadmissible under closure. Cosmological effects must therefore arise as integration constants associated with symmetry reduction, rather than as independent vacuum substances. Weinberg-type results are consistent with this structural restriction.

---

## What the Ananke Theorem Contributes

The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem addresses a question that lies outside the scope of existing results:

- how many gravitational degrees of freedom are admissible in different symmetry regimes;
- when closure exhausts all freedom and when residual structure is unavoidable;
- and how this classification separates vacuum, galactic, and cosmological regimes.

In doing so, Ananke provides a unifying structural perspective that helps place many established theorems within a broader conceptual framework, without altering or superseding their results.

---

## Summary

Established gravity theorems provide rigorous and indispensable results within their respective domains. The Ananke Theorem complements these results by offering a structural classification of gravitational closure across regimes, clarifying why rigidity appears where it does and when departures from purely geometric behaviour are unavoidable.

It is intended not as a replacement for existing theorems, but as a framework that helps organise and contextualise them within a single closure-based perspective.
