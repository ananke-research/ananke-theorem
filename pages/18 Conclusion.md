## 18 — Conclusion

The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem provides a complete structural classification of admissible classical gravitational fields under closure. By imposing classical covariance, quadratic closure with finite conserved energy, and orthogonal modes of response, the theorem exhausts the space of admissible gravitational structures *in principle*.

The central results are threefold:

- **Vacuum rigidity:** isolated vacuum regimes admit zero residual degrees of freedom and are uniquely determined by boundary conditions.
- **Residual uniqueness:** non-vacuum but symmetry-reduced regimes admit exactly one residual degree of freedom, which is redistributive, slaved, and fixed by conservation and orthogonality.
- **Action uniqueness:** the covariant gravitational action is fixed uniquely up to equivalence; any omission renders the admissible structure incomplete, and any addition violates closure.

These results are deductive and parameter-free. They do not rely on phenomenological input, empirical calibration, or modelling choice. Newtonian gravity and vacuum General Relativity emerge necessarily as the maximally constrained limit of the closed gravitational field.

Downstream consequences—galactic scaling laws, cosmological behaviour, and diagnostic criteria—arise only when the classified structure is applied under specific symmetry conditions. They do not enter the theorem itself.

The Ananke Theorem therefore separates what is **structurally inevitable** in classical gravity from what is **regime-dependent**, providing a definitive account of gravitational admissibility under closure.
