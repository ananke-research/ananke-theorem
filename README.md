# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

This repository contains the **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem**, a structural classification result for classical gravity.  
The theorem determines what gravitational field structures are admissible *in principle* once gravity is required to close as a classical field with finite conserved energy under covariance.

The result is deductive and parameter-free. It introduces no phenomenological modelling, no empirical tuning, and no additional matter content. Its conclusions follow by elimination from structural requirements alone.

## What this repository contains

This repository is organised around a single purpose: **to present the Ananke Theorem clearly and canonically**.

It contains:

- the canonical theorem paper (source and PDF),
- a set of short, structured theorem pages that mirror the logical development of the paper,
- minimal material exported to the public website (`ananketheorem.org`).

The paper remains the sole authoritative source. The pages are a navigational and explanatory layer.

## Core result (one paragraph)

Under the axioms of classical covariance, quadratic closure with finite conserved energy, and orthogonal modes of response, classical gravity admits a uniquely determined internal structure. Isolated vacuum regimes possess zero residual degrees of freedom and are rigid; non-vacuum but symmetry-reduced regimes admit exactly one residual degree of freedom, which is redistributive, slaved, and fixed by conservation; and the covariant gravitational action is unique up to equivalence. Newtonian gravity and vacuum General Relativity are recovered necessarily as the maximally constrained limit of the closed gravitational field.

---

While the Ananke Theorem itself is complete at the level of structural classification, its results imply that all gravitational scaling laws across vacuum, galactic, and cosmological regimes arise as consequences of the same closed-field structure under different symmetry conditions; the explicit derivation of these laws is presented separately in the *phenomenological-consequences-of-ananke* repository and is not required for completion of the theorem.
