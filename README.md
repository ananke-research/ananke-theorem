# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

A structural classification result in classical gravity.

The **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem** proves that if gravity is required to **close** as a classical field—i.e., satisfy **classical covariance**, **quadratic closure with finite conserved norm**, and **orthogonal modes of response**—then the admissible covariant gravitational structure is essentially fixed (up to boundary terms and invertible local field redefinitions).

**Implications (structural, not phenomenological):**
- **Vacuum rigidity:** In isolated vacuum regimes, closure admits **zero residual degrees of freedom**, enforcing exact vacuum GR behaviour as the closed equilibrium (constraint) sector.
- **Single non-vacuum residual DOF:** In non-vacuum regimes with sufficient symmetry reduction, closure admits **exactly one** conserved residual degree of freedom (no more, no less).
- **Scaling laws as corollaries:** Under the corresponding symmetry reductions, that single residual constant yields the known galactic and cosmological scaling laws as algebraic consequences (e.g. BTFR/RAR/MDA and pressureless a-3 scaling), without introducing new particles, halo models, or interpolation functions.
- **Emergent geometry:** Spacetime geometry is treated as **derivative**—a record of field organisation—rather than ontologically primitive.
