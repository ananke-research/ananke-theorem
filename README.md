# The Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

**A structural classification of admissible classical gravity**

This repository is the canonical public record for the **Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem** and its downstream consequences.

The public website for the project is:

**https://ananketheorem.org**

The Ananke Theorem is **not a modified-gravity model** and does not introduce new phenomenological assumptions.  
It is a **classification theorem**: given minimal structural requirements already implicit in classical gravity, it determines what gravitational field structures are admissible *in principle*.

## 1. Core Question

What gravitational response structures are possible once gravity is required to **close as a classical field**?

By *closure* we mean:

- finite, self-contained conserved energy,
- exhaustion of degrees of freedom under symmetry,
- no reliance on external bookkeeping, hidden components, or regime-dependent prescriptions.

The theorem asks **what must follow** if gravity is treated as a closed classical interaction.

---

## 2. Main Result (Informal Statement)

Under three minimal structural requirements:

1. **Classical covariance**  
2. **Quadratic closure with finite conserved norm**  
3. **Orthogonal modes of response**

the admissible structure of classical gravity is fixed.

### Consequences

- **Vacuum rigidity**  
  In isolated vacuum regimes, closure admits **zero residual degrees of freedom**.  
  Gravity is rigid, unique, and reduces *exactly* to Newtonian gravity and vacuum General Relativity.

- **Non-vacuum symmetry-reduced regimes**  
  In non-vacuum regimes with sufficient symmetry, closure admits **exactly one** residual degree of freedom.  
  This degree of freedom:
  - is redistributive rather than sourcing,
  - cannot propagate independently in vacuum,
  - appears only as a conserved integration constant,
  - vanishes continuously in the vacuum limit.

- **Uniqueness of the admissible action**  
  The covariant gravitational action consistent with closure is fixed **up to equivalence**.  
  No additional fields, potentials, screening mechanisms, or free functions are admissible.

## 3. What This Explains (Structurally)

Without introducing dark matter or dark energy *as substances*, the closure framework explains why:

- GR is exact and unmodified in vacuum and high-acceleration regimes.
- Galaxy-scale regularities (BTFR, RAR/MDA) arise as algebraic consequences of a single residual degree of freedom under stationarity and symmetry.
- Homogeneous cosmology admits a unique pressureless \( a^{-3} \) scaling as a structural consequence of closure, not an assumption.
- A single conserved integration constant appears across non-vacuum symmetry-reduced regimes, while no such constant is permitted in vacuum.

These results are **classification results**, not curve fits.

## 4. What This Is *Not*

- Not a phenomenological modified-gravity model  
- Not MOND, TeVeS, Einstein–Æther, or a variant thereof  
- Not a cosmological model proposal  
- Not a claim that dark matter or dark energy “do not exist”

The theorem is conditional and structural:  
**if** gravity closes classically, **then** these consequences follow.

## 7. Logical Status

The Ananke framework proceeds **deductively**.

- No observational inputs are used in the classification.
- No parameters are fitted.
- No regimes are interpolated by hand.

Phenomenological consequences arise *only* after symmetry reduction exhausts functional freedom.

Violation of a structural necessity falsifies closure itself.

### Summary

> **The Ananke Theorem establishes what gravity must be if it is to close.**  
> It explains the rigidity of vacuum gravity and the necessity of a single residual degree of freedom beyond vacuum—without modifying General Relativity where it is exact.
