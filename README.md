# Ananke (Gravitational Closure) Theorem

The **Ananke Theorem** is a recent structural result in classical gravity.

It proves that if gravity is required to close as a classical field with finite conserved energy and no residual functional freedom, then:

- Vacuum General Relativity is recovered exactly as a closed equilibrium limit.
- Outside vacuum, exactly one additional degree of freedom is admitted.
- This single degree of freedom algebraically accounts for observed galactic and cosmological scaling laws, without dark matter or dark energy as substances.

The theorem derives a **unique admissible covariant action** from three axioms:
- classical covariance,
- quadratic closure with finite conserved energy,
- orthogonality of response modes.
